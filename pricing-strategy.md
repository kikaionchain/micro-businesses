# Pricing Strategy — All 8 Products

## Philosophy
- Impulse buy range: $29–$79 (under $100 = no deliberation)
- Entry tier gets them in, upsell tier captures the serious buyer
- "Pay what you want minimum" option considered but skip for now — sets wrong expectation
- Price in USD, settled in USDC via For Crypto

## Revenue Math (Conservative — Solo tier only, 50 sales/month each)

| Product | Price | Units | Revenue |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| VESSEL | $47 | 50 | $2,350 |
| DRAFT | $39 | 50 | $1,950 |
| STACK | $49 | 50 | $2,450 |
| BLUEPRINT | $79 | 50 | $3,950 |
| LEDGER | $29 | 50 | $1,450 |
| FLOW | $47 | 50 | $2,350 |
| PULSE | $37 | 50 | $1,850 |
| FORGE | $59 | 50 | $2,950 |
| **TOTAL** | | **400** | **$19,300** |

## Revenue Math (Moderate — mix of tiers, 100 units/month total per product)

Blended average price per product (solo + team mix at 70/30):
$19,300 × 2 × 1.25 blended tier uplift = **~$48,250/month**

## Revenue Math (Target: $100K/month)

Needs: ~250 total sales/month across all 8 at blended $50 AOV = $100K
That's 31 sales per product per month. With cosell amplification on For Crypto, very achievable.

## Cosell Commission Setting

When listing on For Crypto, set cosell commission at:
- 20% for $29–$49 products (attractive to cosellers, still 80% margin)
- 15% for $59–$79 products
- 10% for $97–$149 products (higher absolute dollar per sale)

This makes our products the most attractive in the marketplace for cosellers to promote.
