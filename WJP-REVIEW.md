## How to Review Each Product

For each product, do this:
1. Open `businesses/XX-name/brand.md` — does the persona feel real and distinct?
2. Open `businesses/XX-name/product-content.md` — scroll through. Does it feel worth the price?
3. Open `businesses/XX-name/listing.md` — would you buy this from the listing copy alone?
4. Look at images in `businesses/XX-name/images/` — cover, preview, social

That's the full product. Everything else is ready to assemble.

## Things to Flag / Decisions Needed

1. **Pricing tiers** — each product has a Solo + Team/Pro tier. Confirm you want both or just Solo for launch.
2. **Free lead magnets** — research shows free lite versions build email lists and upsell well. Recommend LEDGER Lite (free) post-launch. Decision yours.
3. **Video walkthroughs** — adding a 5-min Loom per product increases perceived value significantly. Worth doing before launch or after?
4. **Launch sequence** — DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md recommends LEDGER first, then waves over 4 weeks. Or: launch all 8 at once. What feels right?
5. **Bundling** — post-launch, "Founder Pack" (VESSEL + FORGE + BLUEPRINT) at $129 (vs $185 solo) is a clear next product. When?

## Revenue Projection Reminder

Conservative (50 sales/month each, solo tier only):
- 8 products × avg $46 × 50 sales = **$18,400/month**

Moderate (100 sales/month, tier mix):
- Blended with 30% upgrading to Pro tier = **~$48K/month**

Path to $100K:
- All 8 products at avg 250 total monthly sales = **$100K+**
