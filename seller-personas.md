## Cross-Brand Rules

- Never use same adjectives across brands
- Never use same color within 2 shades of another brand's primary
- Never have two sellers in the same city/background
- Each seller has a specific "why I built this" story — unique, specific, believable
- No two products solve the exact same problem
