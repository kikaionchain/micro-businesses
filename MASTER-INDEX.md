Each business must look like a different person made it:
- Different color palette
- Different typography direction
- Different tone of voice
- Different seller name/bio
- Different product aesthetic
- No cross-references between products
- No shared language that signals same creator

## Launch Sequence (Post-WJP Approval)

1. Create For Crypto seller account (separate from main WJP account)
2. Launch LEDGER first (lowest price, easiest entry, proves model)
3. Launch DRAFT + STACK same week (recurring revenue starts)
4. Launch VESSEL + FLOW week 2 (higher ticket)
5. Launch PULSE + BLUEPRINT week 3
6. Launch FORGE week 4
7. First cosell partner outreach after all 8 live

## Notes
- Products are independent. Each stands alone, no bundles yet.
- Bundles (e.g., "VESSEL + FORGE = Founder Pack at $89") can be added post-launch.
- Email capture: each product should include a "reply for updates" mechanism to build owned audience.
- WJP review required before ANY listing goes live.
