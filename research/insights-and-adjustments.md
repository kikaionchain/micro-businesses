## Key Findings That Change Our Approach

### 1. Naming Is Strong — Minor Tweaks
Our single-word names (VESSEL, DRAFT, STACK, BLUEPRINT, LEDGER, FLOW, PULSE, FORGE) match the premium creator naming pattern used by top sellers like Easlo, Traf. No changes needed.

One upgrade: STACK listing copy should lean hard into the word "Vault" — competitor research shows it's a high-converting word. Title should be "The Crypto AI Prompt Vault" even though brand is called STACK.

### 2. Pricing Validation
Our prices are at/above the market midpoint — which is correct positioning (crypto audience pays more).
- LEDGER $29: Matches sweet spot perfectly. No change.
- VESSEL $47: Slightly above category ($39-49 typical for Notion templates). Keep — the extra quality justifies it.
- FLOW $47: PDF playbooks sell $29-$97. Keep — we're adding Notion elements to justify.
- DRAFT $39: Upper end of content template range. Keep — crypto-specific justifies premium.
- STACK $49: Right in the prompt pack sweet spot. Keep.
- PULSE $37: Slightly above Twitter template range ($9-$19 typical) — but our includes full guide. Keep.
- BLUEPRINT $79: Top end but Figma design systems sell $79-$149. Keep.
- FORGE $59: Notion workspace templates sell $29-$99. Keep.

### 3. Free Tier / Lead Magnet Opportunity
Top sellers use a free tier to build email list, then upsell. 
Recommendation: Build a free "lite" version of LEDGER (Ledger Lite — just Portfolio Overview database, free) that upsells to $29 full version.
Also: DRAFT free "7 days of crypto content" (7 free templates) that upsells to 90-day pack.

### 4. "Video Tutorial" Increases Perceived Value
Top-selling Notion templates include video walkthroughs. This reduces returns and increases perceived value significantly.
Recommendation: For each product's premium tier, note "includes loom walkthrough video." 
This is easy to add — 5-min Loom per product when we're ready to launch.

### 5. Product Bundling = Big Revenue Upside
Crypto sellers bundle products for 2-3x revenue. Pattern: "Buy all 3 tools for $97" when each is $47.
Recommendation post-launch: 
- "Founder Pack" = VESSEL + FORGE + BLUEPRINT ($47 + $59 + $79 = $185) → bundle at $129
- "Operator Pack" = STACK + LEDGER + PULSE ($49 + $29 + $37 = $115) → bundle at $79
- "Full Vault" = All 8 products ($386 individual) → bundle at $197

### 6. Platform SEO Matters
For Crypto listing tags should include: crypto, notion template, web3, token launch, community, trading, AI prompts — all high-search terms on digital product platforms.
Tags already included in listing.md files.

### 7. "Lite" Naming Creates Upgrade Path
Pattern: Product Lite → Product (full) → Product Pro
This is a proven upgrade funnel. We can implement this in batch after initial launch.
