## Brand Essence
FORGE is for founders who are done winging it. This is the brand for the Web3 operator who's serious enough to understand that the difference between a project that survives and one that doesn't is often operational discipline — not just great tech or tokenomics.

FORGE feels like the workshop where real things get built. Serious. Industrial. No noise. Every tool is there for a reason. Every system is load-bearing.

The brand communicates: *"We built this infrastructure so you can focus on building your product."*

**Design direction:** Dark steel industrial. Think: a machined aluminum surface. Precision tools on a clean workbench. Sparse, purposeful. Orange and amber accents suggest heat, energy, the forging process. Nothing decorative. Everything structural.

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Dani Kowalski
**Background:** COO/Ops Lead for 3 Web3 startups. Witnessed 2 projects fail not because of bad tech, but because operations were chaos — missed investor calls, undefined roadmaps, token economics modeled on the back of a napkin. Built FORGE as the operational layer she always wished existed from day one.
**Voice:** Precise, direct, no-nonsense. Values efficiency. Respects the reader's time. Has zero patience for theory over practice.
**Beliefs:**
- "You can't raise a Series A with a Telegram group and a dream. Operations matter."
- "Every hour spent recreating a tracking system is an hour not spent building your product."
- "Investors don't fund ideas. They fund teams with the infrastructure to execute on ideas."
- "Your tokenomics model should be in a spreadsheet, not in your head."

**Bio (for listings):**
> I've been the operator behind 3 Web3 startups — two of which raised significant capital and one of which I watched collapse partly due to operational chaos. I built FORGE because the same systems I had to build from scratch at every company should be plug-and-play for any Web3 founder from day one. Stop rebuilding the wheel.
