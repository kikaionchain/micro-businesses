## FULL LISTING DESCRIPTION

### Most Web3 Startups Fail Operationally, Not Technically

The team was smart. The tech worked. The vision was real.

But the investor conversations were tracked in a group chat. The roadmap was a notion page last updated 4 months ago. Token economics lived in the founder's head and a half-finished spreadsheet. The launch countdown was being coordinated over DMs.

This is how promising projects fall apart — not from bad ideas, but from operational chaos that erodes trust, delays execution, and makes experienced investors walk away.

**FORGE is the operational infrastructure you need from day one.**

### 7 Complete Systems. One Workspace.

**🗺️ Roadmap Tracker**
A professional roadmap database with priority tiers, ownership, quarter targets, success criteria, and 6 pre-built views including an auto-updating "Overdue" alert and a shareable public roadmap view. Start communicating your vision credibly.

**✅ Team Task Board**
A sprint-ready task board with 7 views: Sprint Board (Kanban), My Tasks, All Open Tasks, Blocked Tasks, Overdue, Backlog, and Done This Week. Categories, priority, estimated time, assignee — everything your team needs to stay aligned without a meeting for every question.

**💼 Investor CRM**
A complete investor relationship management system with 25+ fields covering contact details, check size, stage focus, portfolio, pipeline status, conviction level, documents shared, diligence status, and pass reasons. 6 views including "Needs Follow-up" (your daily priority list), "Warm Intro Available," and "Passed — Learnings." Never drop an investor relationship again.

**🪙 Token Economics Model**
A structured template for building your tokenomics from scratch: allocation table, vesting schedule timeline, circulating supply calculator, value accrual mechanics framework, valuation comparables table, and a 10-point red flag checklist. Built to be the single source of truth for your token model.

**📅 Launch Timeline**
A 120-day countdown template broken into 4 phases: Critical Path (-90 to -61 days), Build Phase (-60 to -31 days), Launch Prep (-30 to -1 days), and Post-Launch (Days 1-30). Every task has an owner slot and status tracker. Plus a structured Launch Day hour-by-hour run sheet.

**📝 Meeting Notes**
A professional meeting note template with structured sections: attendees, agenda, discussion notes, decisions made, action items (with owner + due date), open questions, and next meeting info. Plus a Meeting Notes database to store and search every meeting you've ever had.

**👥 Hiring Pipeline**
A complete recruiting CRM: 25+ fields per candidate including role, source, pipeline stage, technical screen status, interview scores, compensation details, and notes. 6 views to manage your recruiting funnel from "Sourced" to "Offer Accepted." Stop losing track of good candidates.

### Who This Is For

- Web3 founders who are pre-launch and need operational infrastructure before they need it most
- Founders who are mid-build and have operational chaos they need to clean up
- COOs and Chief of Staff hires who want a full system on day one
- Any Web3 team with more than 2 people and no shared operational layer

### What Investors Will Notice

When an investor asks to see your data room and you send them a structured Notion workspace with a clean roadmap, a populated investor CRM showing you track relationships, and a token economics model that's clearly been thought through — that is a signal.

It signals: *this team operates like a real company.*

That signal is worth more than the $59 you paid for the system.

---

### Why $59?

An operations consultant charges $150-300/hour to build these systems from scratch. A Chief of Staff's first task at most startups is rebuilding the operational layer that should have existed from day one.

This workspace takes 2-3 hours to set up. It replaces months of "I'll get to that."

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to know Notion to use this?**
Basic Notion familiarity helps, but the setup guide walks you through every step. If you can use Notion to take notes, you can use FORGE.

**Does this require a paid Notion plan?**
The free Notion plan works for solo use. For teams (multiple users collaborating), you'll need Notion's Team plan ($8-10/user/month). For a 3-5 person founding team, this is a negligible cost.

**Can I customize the databases?**
Completely. Add properties, remove ones you don't need, create new views. The databases are starting points, not locked systems.

**My project is pre-token — is the token economics module useful?**
Yes. Working through the tokenomics template forces you to make decisions you'll need to have made anyway. Better to stress-test your model in Notion at month 2 than in an investor meeting at month 6.

**Can I share parts of this with my team or advisors?**
Yes — Notion allows you to share individual pages with specific people. Share the Roadmap page with advisors, the Investor CRM with your co-founder only, and the Task Board with your whole team — all separately.
