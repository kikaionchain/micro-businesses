## Self-Assessment: Is This Silicon Valley Ready?

**Product quality: YES**
- 100 prompts are genuinely useful — not filler. Each has [VARIABLES] for customization and a "CUSTOMIZE:" note.
- Covers the 5 workflows crypto teams actually use daily
- Styled HTML file looks professional, loads instantly, is easy to use
- Worth $49 on content alone

**What it's missing before live:**
- [ ] WJP needs to assign a wallet for the seller account
- [ ] For Crypto listing upload (needs wallet connection)
- [ ] Yama QA pass (poke holes as a new buyer)
- [ ] Cover image quality check (AI-generated, may need re-generation at higher quality)

**Honest gaps:**
- Images are FLUX Schnell ($0.003 each, fast) — good enough for test, but upgrade to FLUX Pro for final versions
- No video/animation yet (WJP mentioned animations — can add a browser-recorded demo of the HTML file opening)
- Seller account not yet created on For Crypto (needs wallet)

## Next Steps (in order)

1. WJP reviews the HTML product file and images — confirms quality bar
2. WJP assigns a wallet address for "Marcus Reeve" account
3. Kikai uploads to For Crypto (listing + images + file)
4. Yama QA pass — acts as first-time buyer, pokes holes
5. Kikai addresses Yama's findings
6. Mark STACK as COMPLETE, use this sprint as the template for the other 59 products
