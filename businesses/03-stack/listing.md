## FAQ (3 Questions)

**Q: Which AI models do these prompts work with?**
A: All prompts are tested with and optimized for ChatGPT-4, Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini. They work with any major language model. The more context you add to the [VARIABLE] fields, the better the output from any model.

**Q: Do I need AI experience to use these?**
A: No. If you can copy-paste and fill in brackets, you can use every prompt in STACK. The [VARIABLE] system removes the guesswork — you provide your project's specific details, the AI does the rest. A short usage guide is included.

**Q: Can I edit and reuse these prompts for multiple projects?**
A: Yes. Once you purchase STACK, the prompts are yours to use across any project, indefinitely. There are no restrictions on use, adaptation, or how many times you run them.
