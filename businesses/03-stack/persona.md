# STACK — Seller Persona

## Identity
**Name:** Marcus Reeve
**Handle:** @marcusreeve_
**Tagline:** "AI systems for crypto operators"

## Bio (For Crypto listing)
I've spent 4 years building AI workflows for crypto teams — from seed-stage protocols to top-100 projects. Started as a dev, moved into ops when I realized most of our problems weren't technical. STACK is the prompt library I kept rebuilding from scratch for every team I worked with. Decided to package it properly.

## Short Bio (50 words)
AI systems consultant for crypto teams. 4 years building workflows for protocols at every stage. STACK is the prompt library I rebuilt from scratch too many times — finally packaged it properly so other operators can skip that part.

## Tone
Direct. No crypto hype. Talks like a systems person, not a marketer. Occasionally dry.

## Avatar
