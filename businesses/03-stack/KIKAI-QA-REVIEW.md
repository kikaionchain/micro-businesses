# STACK — Kikai Brutal QA Review
Date: 2026-02-26

**Verdict: Needs 3 fixes before it's ready. Not a rejection — a tune-up.**

## What's Actually Good (be honest about this too)

- The VARIABLE system is executed well. Every prompt has clear [BRACKETS] and a CUSTOMIZE note. This is the differentiator — it's not a list of raw prompts, it's a fill-in-the-blanks system.
- Community management section (prompts 001-020) is genuinely crypto-specific. FUD Response Framework, Crisis Playbook, Governance Participation Guide — these solve real problems any crypto community manager faces daily.
- Token Research section is the strongest. Tokenomics Stress Test (prompt 056) is legitimately good — it teaches operators how to pressure-test themselves before investor meetings.
- The listing copy is clean and direct. "Stop writing the same AI prompts from scratch" is a solid opener.

## What's Weak (the actual problems)

### Problem 1: Content Creation section is too generic (CRITICAL)
Prompts 021-040 — the content section — could apply to any SaaS company. "Write an 8-tweet thread," "write a podcast pitch," "write a pitch deck narrative" — these are basic prompts any competent Claude user can write themselves in 3 minutes. The crypto-specific angle is cosmetic (just "[PROJECT NAME]" swapped in). If someone pays $49 and finds that half the content section is repackaged generic prompt engineering, they'll feel ripped off.

**Fix:** Replace 8-10 of the weakest generic content prompts with crypto-native ones:
- Space airdrop campaign announcement thread (specific mechanics)
- Token unlock event communication (community + investor versions)
- Bear market content strategy (how to keep community engaged through down cycles)
- Meme strategy brief (how to brief a meme creator with on-brand guidance)
- Cross-chain migration announcement

### Problem 2: Investor Outreach section is B2B copy with crypto terms (MODERATE)
"Conference Sponsorship Proposal," "Due Diligence Response Document," "Pitch Deck Narrative" — these are standard business prompts that a corporate copywriter could have written. They don't reflect how crypto fundraising actually works (token rounds vs equity, SAFT agreements, KOL partnerships, community-backed raises). Someone who's done a crypto raise would notice immediately that these are surface-level.

**Fix:** Replace 4-5 weaker investor prompts with:
- SAFT/Token warrant negotiation talking points
- KOL partnership brief (not podcast — this is different in crypto)
- Community raise announcement (announce you're raising via Discord/X, crypto-native style)
- Investor update for a down-market month (where the bad news framing matters)

### Problem 3: The product format needs proof it works (IMPORTANT FOR $49)
The listing says "production-ready prompts" but doesn't SHOW any outputs. A potential buyer sees prompts and wonders: what does the actual AI output look like when I use these? At $49, they're buying trust that the prompts produce good results. Without sample outputs, they're buying blind.

**Fix:** Add one sample output per section header — 5 total. One paragraph of what a good AI response looks like when the prompt is properly filled in. This doesn't require rewriting prompts — just 5 examples in the HTML file.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Community Management | 8/10 | Solid, genuinely crypto-native |
| Content Creation | 5/10 | Too generic, needs crypto-specific rewrites |
| Investor Outreach | 6/10 | Surface-level, misses crypto raise dynamics |
| Token Research | 9/10 | Best section, legitimately useful |
| Launch Planning | 7/10 | Good but some prompts apply to any product launch |

## The $49 Justification Problem

At $49, a buyer is asking: "Can I not just ask ChatGPT to write these prompts for me?" The answer for the best 60% of STACK is "no, these are better than what you'd create yourself." The answer for the weakest 40% is "actually... yeah I could."

The fix isn't lowering the price. It's making 100% of the prompts answer "no" — either because they're crypto-specific enough that you need the domain knowledge to write them, or because the prompt engineering itself is sophisticated enough that casual users wouldn't think of it.

Right now it's about 60/40. It needs to be 85/15.

## 3 Things That Must Be Fixed Before WJP Sees This

1. **Rewrite 8-10 Content Creation prompts** to be crypto-native (airdrop, bear market, meme strategy, token unlock, cross-chain migration)
2. **Add 5 sample AI outputs** (one per section, showing what a prompt actually produces when used correctly) — this is what turns skeptics into buyers
3. **Replace 4-5 weakest Investor Outreach prompts** with ones that reflect actual crypto fundraising mechanics (SAFT, KOL partnerships, community raises)

## What WJP Will Ask

"Would you actually pay $49 for this if someone else made it?"

My honest answer right now: For the community management + token research sections alone, yes. For the full vault as-is, I'd feel like I overpaid by about 30%.

After the fixes: Yes. Easily.
