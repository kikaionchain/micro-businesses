# STACK — Brand Identity

---

## Name
**STACK**

## Tagline
*"Stop prompting. Start producing."*

---

## Brand Concept
STACK is a tool brand for operators — the people who are already using AI in their daily work but spending too much time writing the same type of prompts over and over. The name comes from "tech stack" — the collection of tools and processes that make a team functional. STACK is the AI layer of your operational stack. Efficient, functional, no wasted space.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Terminal Black | `#0A0F0D` |
| Accent | Matrix Green | `#00FF66` |
| Secondary | Muted Sage | `#3D5A47` |

**Usage notes:**
- Terminal Black is the foundation. Everything lives on it.
- Matrix Green is the personality — actively references terminal/code culture. Applied to borders, section labels, key terms in prompt previews, CTAs. Never overused; one green element per visual zone.
- Muted Sage for secondary elements — hover states, metadata, inactive tabs.

**The vibe:** Functional beauty. Like a well-configured terminal. Nothing decorative that doesn't serve information.

## Typography Direction

**Primary:** **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** — monospaced throughout. Every heading, every body. This product is for operators; the type should feel like their environment.

**Secondary:** **Inter** for prose sections (descriptions, instructions) where mono would be too heavy.

**Rule:** Prompts always appear in monospaced type. It signals "this is ready to copy." Non-prompt content in Inter. The contrast makes the product scannable.

## Tone of Voice

- **Operator-to-operator.** No hand-holding. STACK assumes you know how AI works.
- **Precise.** Every word in every prompt earns its place. No filler in the brand copy either.
- **Dry humor, occasionally.** The kind that comes from having written the same type of prompt 200 times and being done with it.
- **Never hype.** "100 prompts" is the value proposition. It doesn't need embellishment.

**Example of on-brand copy:**
> "You know what a good prompt looks like. Writing one from scratch every time anyway is a waste of your intelligence. STACK is what happens when someone builds the library you've been meaning to build."

**Example of off-brand copy:**
> "Harness the POWER of AI with these INCREDIBLE prompts! Your team will be 10x more productive INSTANTLY!"

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Darius Okafor
**Handle:** @darius_stacks
**Bio:** Darius has been building in crypto since 2020 — first as a protocol researcher, then as a growth operator for a mid-size DeFi protocol, then independently as an AI systems consultant for Web3 teams. He started using ChatGPT and Claude in early 2023. By mid-2023 he had a private Google Doc with 300+ prompts that he refined obsessively. In 2024, he packaged the best 100 and sold them. He now works with 3 clients and sells tools on the side. He is available on X but not enthusiastically so.

**Persona notes:**
- Sparse, technical social presence
- Will occasionally post a prompt teardown on X — "here's why this prompt works and this one doesn't"
- No Discord community; no coaching; no upsell
- One product, well-made

## Brand Applications

- **PDF/document layout:** Black background, green section labels, mono type for all prompt text
- **Prompt formatting standard:** Each prompt numbered (001-100), tagged with [CATEGORY] and estimated output quality in brackets [HIGH/MEDIUM OUTPUT], followed by the prompt itself, then a "CUSTOMIZE:" note
- **Section dividers:** Simple `---` style, no decorative elements
