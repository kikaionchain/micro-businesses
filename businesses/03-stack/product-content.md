### 📋 Sample Output — Prompt 002: FUD Response Framework

**Filled variables:**
- PROJECT NAME: Meridian Protocol
- FUD posted: "Meridian's smart contracts were forked from a hacked protocol — your funds aren't safe"
- Evidence available: our Ackee Blockchain audit report, independent code comparison
- Background facts: (1) We forked Aave v3, not the hacked Euler Finance; (2) Our audit found 0 critical, 2 low-severity issues fixed pre-launch; (3) $2.1M in TVL with zero incidents in 4 months

**What the AI produced:**
The concern here is worth addressing directly. Meridian Protocol is built on Aave v3 — one of the most battle-tested codebases in DeFi — not on Euler Finance or any protocol that has experienced an exploit. We've completed an independent audit by Ackee Blockchain (full report linked in #resources) which found zero critical issues, and the two low-severity findings were patched before mainnet launch. If you have specific technical questions about our architecture or any differences from the base codebase, our lead developer would be glad to walk through it in #dev-chat. Transparency on this matters to us more than it matters to the critics.

**033 — Bear Market Community Retention Campaign**
```
Design a 4-week community retention campaign for [PROJECT NAME] during a sustained bear market or low-activity period.

Current state:
- How long has the market been down: [TIMEFRAME]

- What's still working: [WHAT KIND OF POSTS/EVENTS STILL GET ENGAGEMENT]
- What stopped working: [WHAT USED TO WORK BUT DOESN'T NOW]
- Team morale and bandwidth: [HONEST ASSESSMENT]

Retention campaign structure (4 weeks):
Week 1 — Acknowledge reality: Post that validates community feelings without catastrophizing. Builder mindset content. "This is when we build" framing.
Week 2 — Substance drop: A technical post, an audit result, a progress update — something that proves the team is still working. No hype, just receipts.
Week 3 — Community involvement: A governance vote, a community challenge, a call for feedback on something real. Give members agency.
Week 4 — Forward framing: What we're building toward. Specific milestones. Not "soon™" — actual timelines with caveats.

For each week provide:
- 2-3 specific post angles (not just topics — actual angles with a point of view)
- 1 community event or activation idea
- 1 thing to explicitly NOT post (to avoid tone-deaf content)

Tone throughout: Honest and grounded. Communities can smell desperation. Don't pretend it's bull market.

### 📋 Sample Output — Prompt 023: Token Exchange Listing Application

**Filled variables:**
- PROJECT NAME: Meridian Protocol
- EXCHANGE: Bybit (Tier 1 CEX)
- 24h volume: $840K across Uniswap + Raydium
- Holders: 4,200 unique wallets
- Auditor: Ackee Blockchain, March 2026

**What the AI produced:**
Meridian Protocol is a cross-chain lending protocol enabling USDC-collateralized loans on Base and Solana with same-day settlement. We're applying for MRDX/USDT spot listing on Bybit. Current 24-hour trading volume is $840K across Uniswap v3 and Raydium; 4,200 unique holders with 67% holding for 90+ days. Our Ackee Blockchain audit (March 2026) found zero critical vulnerabilities. We're specifically targeting Bybit's DeFi-native user segment — 61% of your spot volume comes from users who also hold at least one governance token, which maps directly to our community profile. We would commit a $150K co-marketing budget for the listing month and can provide volume maker support. We'd like to schedule a 20-minute call with your listing team this week.

### 📋 Sample Output — Prompt 046: KOL Partnership Brief

**Filled variables:**
- KOL: Mid-tier DeFi educator, 85K Twitter followers, 40K YouTube subscribers
- Promotion type: Paid (token allocation, 6-month vesting)
- Campaign: Protocol launch week, March 15-22
- Key message: "Meridian makes cross-chain USDC loans actually simple"

**What the AI produced:**
The brief opens with one paragraph of context: Meridian Protocol is a cross-chain lending protocol on Base and Solana — not another yield farm, not a token launch with no product. The one thing we want your audience to take away: you can now borrow USDC against your SOL or ETH without touching a centralized exchange. The video or thread should show the actual flow — wallet connect, deposit collateral, borrow USDC — not just describe it. Required: include the audit link and the DefiLlama TVL widget. Forbidden: price predictions, ROI claims, comparisons to Aave ("we're better than X" invites scrutiny we don't need at launch), and any language suggesting this is risk-free. Disclosure must appear within the first 30 seconds of any video, first tweet of any thread: "Paid partnership — I hold MRDX tokens with a 6-month vesting cliff."

### 📋 Sample Output — Prompt 078: Technical Due Diligence Questions

**Filled variables:**
- PROJECT: Meridian Protocol
- REVIEWER TYPE: Technical partner evaluating a potential integration
- CODEBASE: Forked from Aave v3, modified for cross-chain USDC routing

**What the AI produced:**
The 15 questions the AI surfaced covered: (1) How the cross-chain message passing is secured — specifically whether the bridge is upgradeable and who controls the upgrade key; (2) What the liquidation mechanism looks like under a simultaneous 30% price drop on both chains; (3) Whether the oracle is TWAP or spot price, and what the heartbeat frequency is; (4) How the protocol handles a scenario where one chain is congested but the other isn't; (5) The exact access control structure — who can pause the protocol and under what conditions. The AI correctly identified that the most likely attack vector isn't the Aave v3 base code but the custom cross-chain bridge logic that Meridian added — which is precisely what a sophisticated technical partner would focus on in a code review.

TOTAL BUDGET AVAILABLE: [USD AMOUNT OR TOKEN EQUIVALENT]

BUDGET CATEGORIES (fill in your estimated allocation):

Security & Audit
- Smart contract audit: $[AMOUNT] (get 3 quotes from: Trail of Bits, Certik, Ackee, OtterSec, Halborn)
- Bug bounty reserve: $[AMOUNT] (typical range: 10-20% of audit cost)
- Legal review of token structure: $[AMOUNT]

Liquidity Provision
- Initial DEX liquidity: $[AMOUNT] (minimum to prevent sandwich attacks: research your DEX's recommended minimum)
- Market maker retainer if CEX: $[AMOUNT]
- Reserve for liquidity crises: $[AMOUNT] (recommend 15% of initial liquidity)

Marketing & KOLs
- KOL budget (itemize by tier): $[AMOUNT]
- PR / media: $[AMOUNT]

2. What's underfunded? What would get cut first if budget shrinks 30%?
3. What single-point-of-failure exists? (e.g., all marketing through one KOL)
4. What's the minimum viable budget if you had to cut 50%?
```

### 📋 Sample Output — Prompt 091: Launch-Day Operations Playbook

**Filled variables:**
- PROJECT NAME: Meridian Protocol
- LAUNCH DATE: March 15, 2026, 14:00 UTC
- TEAM SIZE: 6 people
- EXPECTED TRAFFIC: 2,000 Discord joins in first 6 hours

**What the AI produced:**
H-Hour to H+2: CEO monitors on-chain deployment confirmation and posts the official "we're live" in #announcements only after the first 100 transactions confirm cleanly — not before. CTO stays silent publicly; any incident response goes to internal Slack first. Community lead has pre-written responses to the top 5 expected questions pinned and ready to paste, including one for "is this a rug?" (answer it directly, don't dodge it). H+2 to H+6: If TVL crosses $500K, post a milestone update with a DefiLlama screenshot as proof. If it doesn't, say nothing — silence is better than explaining a slow start. First Twitter Spaces opens at H+4 with CEO and CTO only; community manager filters out any question designed to create panic rather than get an answer. The only metric that matters in the first six hours is whether the protocol is functioning correctly. Price is not a metric. TVL is not a metric. Those are lagging indicators of whether the protocol works.
