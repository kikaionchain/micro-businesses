<hr>
<br>
<p><strong>081 — Launch Timeline Generator</strong></p>
<pre class="prompt">
Create a comprehensive launch timeline for [PROJECT NAME]'s [TOKEN LAUNCH / PRODUCT LAUNCH / FEATURE LAUNCH] targeting [DATE].

Working backwards from [LAUNCH DATE]:

For each milestone, specify:
- Milestone name
- Target date
- Owner (role, not person name if you prefer)
- Dependencies (what must happen before this)
- Go/no-go criteria (how do you know it's ready)

Milestones to plan around (expand with specifics):
1. Final product/contract completion
2. Security audit completion
3. Exchange/DEX listings confirmed
4. Community growth targets
5. Content and marketing preparation
6. Press and media outreach
7. Announcement and launch sequence
8. Post-launch support readiness

Context:
- Team size: [NUMBER]
- Resources: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Known constraints: [E.G., "audit takes 6 weeks / listing requires X weeks notice"]
</pre>
<p><em>CUSTOMIZE: Add external dependencies like third-party integrations or regulatory requirements.</em></p>

<br>
<p><strong>082 — Launch Announcement Strategy</strong></p>
<pre class="prompt">

1. What gets posted (content type)
2. When (exact time sequence on launch day)
3. Who posts it (role)
4. The goal for that channel post
5. Engagement response plan (what happens when people respond)

Then build the 48-hour content sequence:
- T-48h: Tease
- T-24h: Countdown
- T-6h: Final reminder
- T-0: Launch
- T+2h: Milestone post
- T+24h: Day 1 wrap-up

- Expected community size at launch: [CURRENT SIZE + projected launch-day influx]

For each day (Day -1 through Day 7), provide:
- MORNING: One specific post or activation with exact content brief (not just "educational post")
- AFTERNOON/EVENING: One community action (AMA, Twitter Spaces, Discord event, airdrop claim, etc.)
- WATCH: One metric to monitor that day + threshold that would trigger a response (e.g., "if Discord membership drops below X, post the retention message in #general")
- DO NOT POST: One thing to avoid that day (reduces noise and panic)

Day -1 (pre-launch): Final countdown, last questions answered, wallets ready
Day 0 (launch): Hour-by-hour for first 6 hours only — this day needs surgical precision
Day 1-3: Momentum maintenance, new user onboarding, addressing early feedback
Day 4-7: Normalize the new state, cosell activation, community rewards

Flag any activation that requires: Designer (2-day lead time), Legal review (5-day lead time), External partner coordination (3-day lead time)
</pre>
<p><em>CUSTOMIZE: Build this calendar backwards from the launch date — identify your hard dependencies first (exchange go-live, smart contract deployment, audit sign-off) before filling in content.</em></p>

<p><strong>089 — Launch Budget Framework</strong></p>
<pre class="prompt">
Build a launch budget allocation framework for [PROJECT NAME] using the categories below.

I will NOT ask AI to estimate costs — you will fill in your own numbers. This prompt helps you structure the budget, identify what you're missing, and pressure-test the allocation.

TOTAL BUDGET AVAILABLE: [USD AMOUNT OR TOKEN EQUIVALENT]

BUDGET CATEGORIES (fill in your estimated allocation):

Security &amp; Audit
- Smart contract audit: $[AMOUNT] (get 3 quotes from: Trail of Bits, Certik, Ackee, OtterSec, Halborn)
- Bug bounty reserve: $[AMOUNT] (typical range: 10-20% of audit cost)
- Legal review of token structure: $[AMOUNT]

Liquidity Provision
- Initial DEX liquidity: $[AMOUNT] (minimum to prevent sandwich attacks: research your DEX's recommended minimum)
- Market maker retainer if CEX: $[AMOUNT]
- Reserve for liquidity crises: $[AMOUNT] (recommend 15% of initial liquidity)

Marketing &amp; KOLs
- KOL budget (itemize by tier): $[AMOUNT]
- PR / media: $[AMOUNT]
- Community events / AMAs: $[AMOUNT]
- Design/creative: $[AMOUNT]

Infrastructure
- Gas/transaction costs for launch mechanics: $[AMOUNT]
- Airdrop distribution costs: $[AMOUNT if applicable]

Once filled in, analyze:
1. What percentage goes to security vs. marketing? (Red flag if security &lt; 20% of total)
2. What's underfunded? What would get cut first if budget shrinks 30%?
3. What single-point-of-failure exists? (e.g., all marketing through one KOL)
4. What's the minimum viable budget if you had to cut 50%?
</pre>
<p><em>CUSTOMIZE: Get real quotes before filling in the audit line — prices vary 5x between firms and scope matters enormously. Never use AI-generated cost estimates for actual financial planning.</em></p>
