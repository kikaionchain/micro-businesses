## FULL LISTING DESCRIPTION

### You Have Something to Say. This Pack Teaches You How to Say It.

You're in crypto. You understand things most people don't. You have takes, analysis, alpha, stories.

But you post a thread and get 4 likes. You watch accounts with half your knowledge get 10,000 retweets. And you can't figure out why.

**The answer is usually craft, not content.**

The best crypto Twitter accounts aren't posting better ideas than everyone else. They're posting ideas in formats that stop the scroll, build to a payoff, and make people want to follow and share.

PULSE is the system for doing that. **50 ready-to-use thread templates** + **a complete growth guide** built by someone who grew from 0 to 45,000 followers in 14 months on Crypto Twitter.

### What's Inside

**50 Fill-in-the-Blank Thread Templates**

Each template is 5-8 tweets with `[BRACKETS]` for fill-ins, detailed instructions, and notes on why each piece works. Organized into 5 categories:

🔍 **Alpha Threads (10 templates)**
For sharing exclusive insight, on-chain findings, hidden protocol discoveries, and data analysis. These are the threads that get saved, bookmarked, and shared to Discord servers.
*Includes: "I Found Something," "The On-Chain Signal," "The Hidden Protocol," "The Narrative Play," "Whale Wallet Watch" + 5 more*

💬 **Opinion Threads (10 templates)**
For sharing strong perspectives, valuations, cycle calls, and honest takes. These are the threads that get replies and debates — which means distribution.
*Includes: "The Unpopular Opinion," "The Industry Critique," "Why [Token] Is Undervalued," "The Market Cycle Take" + 6 more*

🎓 **Educational Threads (10 templates)**
For teaching. These build the deepest long-term following because they establish expertise. People bookmark and return to these.
*Includes: "Beginner's Guide to [Concept]," "The [Number] Things I Wish I'd Known," "How [Protocol] Actually Works," "The DeFi Safety Checklist" + 6 more*

📖 **Storytelling Threads (10 templates)**
For narrative-driven content that builds connection. Your origin story, a trade post-mortem, a bear market survival story. These build the most loyal followers.
*Includes: "The Origin Story," "The Trade Story," "The Bear Market Survival Story," "The Night Everything Changed" + 6 more*

🔥 **Controversy / Hot Take Threads (10 templates)**
For bold positions, uncomfortable truths, and things CT doesn't want to hear. These generate the most engagement per post — used wisely, they build reputation.
*Includes: "The Hard Truth," "The Hot Take List," "[Thing Everyone Loves] Is Actually Bad," "My Most Controversial Position" + 6 more*

⏰ **Posting Schedule** — minimum viable schedule, optimal weekly calendar, best times to post for crypto audiences, thread timing for algorithm optimization

💬 **Engagement Tactics** — the reply strategy (what works vs. what's wasted time), how to build relationships not just followers, quote tweet vs. retweet

🚀 **How to Go Viral in Crypto** — the 5 hook patterns that stop the scroll, what makes threads get shared, what kills threads

💰 **How to Turn Followers into Buyers** — the trust funnel, the 4 content types that build buyers, how to sell without being annoying, the right pricing and positioning language for Twitter

✅ **Profile Audit Checklist** — run through this before you post your first thread

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need any experience on Twitter?**
No. The growth guide starts from the basics. If you have a profile but haven't gotten traction, this is especially for you.

**How fast will I see results?**
With consistent effort (1 thread/week, daily engagement), most people see meaningful growth within 30-60 days. Twitter rewards consistency above all else.

**Are these templates really fill-in-the-blank?**
Yes — all fill-ins are marked with [BRACKETS]. The templates also include notes explaining what to put in each bracket so you produce quality content, not generic filler.

**Can I use these for my project's account (not personal)?**
Absolutely. Many templates work for both personal and project accounts. The opinion and storytelling templates work best for personal brands; the alpha and educational templates adapt well for project accounts.

**Is this a tool or software?**
No — this is a PDF/document pack. Templates you read, customize, and use. No logins, no apps, no subscriptions.
