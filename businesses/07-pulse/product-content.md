# HOW TO USE THIS PACK

Every template in this pack uses `[BRACKETS]` for fill-in-the-blanks.

Each thread is 5-8 tweets. Tweet 1 is always the hook. The rest build toward a payoff. The final tweet is always a CTA.

**Before you use these templates:**
- Read the Growth Guide first (pages after the templates)
- Understand your audience — pick templates that match their interests
- Customize the brackets with specific, concrete details. Generic fill-ins produce generic threads.
- The best threads feel personal. Make them yours.

# PART 1: THE 50 THREAD TEMPLATES

---

## SECTION A: ALPHA THREADS (10 Templates)
*Alpha threads share exclusive insight, hidden data, or information most people don't have. These get saved and shared most.*

---

### Template A-01: "I Found Something"
*Hook: discovery that seems counterintuitive*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I spent [TIME PERIOD] analyzing [DATA SOURCE/PLATFORM].

What I found about [TOPIC] is something most people are completely missing.

Here's the alpha: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
First, some context.

[TOPIC] is widely misunderstood because [COMMON MISCONCEPTION].

Most people think [WRONG ASSUMPTION].

The reality is very different.

**Tweet 3:**
The data shows [SPECIFIC FINDING #1].

This matters because [WHY IT MATTERS TO READER].

[Optional: link to data source or screenshot description]

**Tweet 4:**
Going deeper: [SPECIFIC FINDING #2].

Compare this to [BASELINE/COMPARISON].

That's [X times] more/less than what most people assume.

**Tweet 5:**
The implication for [READER TYPE, e.g., "traders" / "holders" / "builders"] is:

→ [IMPLICATION 1]
→ [IMPLICATION 2]
→ [IMPLICATION 3]

**Tweet 6:**
Most people will ignore this because [REASON MOST MISS IT].

That's the opportunity.

The window to act on this is [TIME FRAME — be specific or honest if unknown].

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
If you found this useful, follow me [@HANDLE] — I post this kind of analysis every [FREQUENCY].

And RT the first tweet if you think others should see this.

### Template A-02: "The On-Chain Signal"
*Hook: specific on-chain data pattern that predicts something*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Something interesting just showed up on-chain for [TOKEN/PROTOCOL].

When this pattern appeared before, [WHAT HAPPENED NEXT].

It's happening again. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Here's the setup.

[PROTOCOL/TOKEN] has [METRIC — e.g., "seen whale accumulation"] at [SPECIFIC DATA POINT].

Last time this happened was [DATE/TIMEFRAME].

**Tweet 3:**
What followed: [WHAT HAPPENED IN PREVIOUS INSTANCE].

Price moved [X]% in [TIMEFRAME].

I'm not saying it'll happen again. I'm saying it's worth watching.

**Tweet 4:**
Here's why this signal matters:

[PROTOCOL/MECHANISM EXPLANATION — why this on-chain metric is meaningful]

It means [SPECIFIC INTERPRETATION].

**Tweet 5:**
The counterargument: [REASON THIS MIGHT NOT PLAY OUT THE SAME WAY].

Fair point. Here's why I still think it's notable: [YOUR RESPONSE].

**Tweet 6:**
How I'm using this information:
→ [WHAT YOU'RE DOING / WATCHING]
→ [What would change your view]
→ [What level/condition would confirm or deny]

### Template A-03: "The Hidden Protocol"
*Hook: a project most people haven't heard of but should know about*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Most of CT hasn't heard of [PROJECT NAME] yet.

In [TIMEFRAME], I think that changes.

Here's why [X] people are quietly accumulating: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
[PROJECT NAME] is solving [PROBLEM].

The existing solutions are [EXISTING SOLUTIONS] and they have these problems:
→ [PROBLEM 1]
→ [PROBLEM 2]

[PROJECT NAME]'s approach is different: [THEIR APPROACH IN ONE LINE].

**Tweet 3:**
The numbers that caught my attention:

→ TVL/Volume/Users: [METRIC]

[INTERPRETATION: what these numbers tell you]

**Tweet 4:**
The team: [BRIEF TEAM DESCRIPTION].

Background: [KEY CREDENTIALS without being a fanboy].

Red flags I checked for: [WHAT YOU LOOKED AT — tokenomics, vesting, team doxxed?]

Findings: [HONEST ASSESSMENT].

**Tweet 5:**
The risks (being fair):

→ [RISK 1]
→ [RISK 2]
→ [RISK 3]

I'm not ignoring these. They're why this isn't a larger position for me.

**Tweet 6:**
My thesis in one sentence: [YOUR THESIS — be specific].

Time horizon: [TIMEFRAME].

Conditions that would invalidate this thesis: [WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU WRONG].

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

### Template A-04: "The Narrative Play"
*Hook: emerging narrative you spotted early*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
There's a narrative building in crypto that almost nobody is talking about yet.

By the time CT catches on, the easy money will be gone.

Here's what I'm seeing: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The narrative: [NARRATIVE NAME/CONCEPT].

What it means: [EXPLAIN IN ONE PARAGRAPH — plain language].

Why now: [CATALYST OR TIMING DRIVER].

**Tweet 3:**
The evidence:

→ [DATA POINT 1 that supports narrative building]
→ [DATA POINT 2]
→ [DATA POINT 3 — could be protocol launches, VC funding, regulatory news, developer activity]

**Tweet 4:**
Historical parallel: the closest thing to this I've seen was [PREVIOUS NARRATIVE, e.g., "DeFi summer 2020" / "NFT boom 2021"].

What happened then: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION].

Key difference this time: [HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT / BETTER / WORSE].

**Tweet 5:**
The protocols positioned to benefit most:

1. [PROJECT A] — because [REASON]
2. [PROJECT B] — because [REASON]
3. [PROJECT C] — because [REASON]

[Caveat: this is research, not a buy list]

**Tweet 6:**
The timeline I'm watching:

→ [SHORT TERM: what confirms the narrative is developing]
→ [MEDIUM TERM: what mainstreams it]
→ [WHAT WOULD KILL THE NARRATIVE]

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
Follow me [@HANDLE] — I map narratives before they hit the mainstream.

### Template A-05: "DeFi Deep Dive"
*Hook: revealing how a specific protocol actually works under the hood*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I spent [TIME] reading through [PROTOCOL NAME]'s [DOCS/CODE/AUDIT].

Most people using it don't understand how it actually works.

Here's what I found (including the risks nobody talks about): 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
What [PROTOCOL] does on the surface:
[SIMPLE DESCRIPTION — what users think it does]

What it actually does:
[DEEPER MECHANICS — what's happening under the hood]

**Tweet 3:**
The fee structure:
→ Protocol takes [%] on [WHAT]
→ LPs earn [%] on [WHAT]
→ Token holders earn [%] on [WHAT] (if applicable)

Most users have no idea these fees exist or where they go.

**Tweet 4:**
The smart contract risk:

→ Audit status: [AUDITED BY WHO / NOT AUDITED]
→ TVL at risk: [$AMOUNT]
→ Admin key situation: [MULTISIG? WHO HOLDS? TIMELOCK?]
→ Oracle dependency: [WHAT ORACLE, WHAT RISK]

**Tweet 5:**
The tokenomics:
→ Supply: [TOTAL / CIRCULATING]
→ Inflation rate: [ANNUAL %]
→ Vesting schedule: [WHO UNLOCKS WHEN]
→ Value accrual: [HOW TOKEN BENEFITS FROM PROTOCOL GROWTH]

**Tweet 6:**
My honest take:

Strengths: [2-3 genuine strengths]
Weaknesses: [2-3 genuine concerns]
Would I use/hold it: [YOUR HONEST ANSWER AND WHY]

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

### Template A-06: "The Contrarian Data Take"
*Hook: data that contradicts popular belief*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Everyone says [COMMON BELIEF ABOUT CRYPTO].

The data says something completely different.

Thread: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The popular narrative: [WHAT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE AND WHY].

It sounds reasonable. The problem is [WHY IT'S WRONG OR MORE COMPLICATED].

**Tweet 3:**
Here's what the data actually shows: [DATA SOURCE + SPECIFIC NUMBERS].

This contradicts the narrative because [EXPLANATION].

**Tweet 4:**
Why does the wrong narrative persist?

→ [REASON 1 — e.g., incentive to repeat it]
→ [REASON 2 — e.g., survivorship bias]
→ [REASON 3 — e.g., it's emotionally satisfying]

**Tweet 5:**
The actual picture when you look at the full data:

[MORE NUANCED VIEW — be fair, not just contrarian for its own sake]

**Tweet 6:**
What this means practically:

If you've been acting on [WRONG BELIEF], you might want to reconsider [SPECIFIC DECISION].

The correct mental model is: [YOUR CORRECTED FRAMEWORK].

I've saved [AMOUNT] in gas fees this year doing [X simple thing].

Most people are still paying 3-10x more than they need to.

Here's how to stop: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The basics most people know but don't apply:

[TIP 1 about gas timing]
[TIP 2 about gas settings]

But this isn't about the basics.

**Tweet 3:**
The thing that actually moved the needle for me: [YOUR MAIN TIP — be specific and technical enough to be credible].

How to do it: [STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS].

Time to set up: [MINUTES].
Time saved per transaction: [ESTIMATED SAVINGS].

**Tweet 4:**
The tools I use:

→ [TOOL 3] for [PURPOSE]

All free. None referral links.

**Tweet 5:**
Advanced move: [MORE SOPHISTICATED TIP — for power users].

This requires [WHAT IT REQUIRES], but if you're doing [VOLUME], the savings add up to [ESTIMATED TOTAL].

**Tweet 6:**
Common mistakes:
→ [MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE]
→ [ANOTHER COMMON ERROR]
→ [ERROR THAT COSTS PEOPLE THE MOST]

### Template A-08: "The Airdrop Playbook"
*Hook: specific airdrop farming strategy*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
[PROJECT NAME] hasn't announced a token yet.

But based on [INDICATORS], one is coming.

Here's how to farm it properly: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Why I think there's a token coming:

→ [INDICATOR 1 — e.g., VC backing, competitor tokens, team hints]
→ [INDICATOR 2]
→ [INDICATOR 3]

This is speculation, not confirmation.

**Tweet 3:**
The protocol: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION of what it does and why it matters].

Current stats: [TVL/USERS/VOLUME — signals it's real].

**Tweet 4:**
How to position for the airdrop:

Step 1: [ACTION — e.g., "Create a wallet and bridge ETH to their chain"]
Step 2: [ACTION — e.g., "Use the protocol at least X times per week"]
Step 3: [ACTION — e.g., "Maintain X minimum balance / volume"]
Step 4: [ACTION — e.g., "Join their Discord and stay active"]

**Tweet 5:**
Pro move: [ONE ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION most farmers don't do].

I've seen this make the difference between [BASE TIER] and [HIGHER TIER] in similar airdrops.

**Tweet 6:**
Cost to farm: [ESTIMATED $$ and time commitment].

Risk: [SMART CONTRACT RISK + LOW-TOKEN-VALUE RISK].

Expected range if it plays out: [ROUGH RANGE based on similar projects].

**Tweet 4:**
The winner on this metric: [L2 NAME].

Why this matters: [PRACTICAL IMPLICATION for users/developers].

**Tweet 5:**
The surprise finding: [SOMETHING UNEXPECTED that you found].

I didn't expect [L2] to [RESULT] because [ASSUMPTION I HAD]. But [ACTUAL RESULT].

**Tweet 6:**
What I didn't measure (important caveat):

→ [METRIC YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE AND WHY IT MATTERS]
→ [LIMITATION OF THIS ANALYSIS]

Full picture requires looking at all of these together.

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

[ARGUMENT 2]

**Tweet 4:**
Comparable valuations:

### Template B-05: "The Builder vs. Speculator Debate"
*Hook: philosophical take on crypto participation*

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
There are two kinds of people in crypto: those who are here to [BUILD / SPECULATE], and those who are here to [SPECULATE / BUILD].

Both are valid. But they need to stop pretending to be the other.

🧵

What they get right: [GENUINE STRENGTHS]
What they get wrong: [HONEST CRITIQUE]

The best outcome happens when: [HOW THE TWO ARCHETYPES COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER].

Examples of this working well: [EXAMPLES — eras, projects, or types of dynamics].

# PART 2: THE CRYPTO TWITTER GROWTH GUIDE

## SECTION 1: PROFILE OPTIMIZATION

### The 4 Seconds Test
You have 4 seconds to convince someone your profile is worth following. That's how long the average person looks at a profile before deciding. Everything in your profile setup should pass this test.

### Profile Photo
**What works:**
- Clear face photo (highest trust, highest follow rate for personal brands)
- Recognizable brand logo (if you're a project account)
- High-contrast illustration or avatar that's distinctive (if you prefer privacy)

**What doesn't work:**
- Blurry photos
- Group photos
- Dark photos where you can't see your face
- Random crypto artwork with no identity attached

**The rule:** If someone can't recognize your photo in a Twitter notification thumbnail, it's not working.

### Username (@handle)
- Short (under 15 characters ideal)
- Memorable
- Related to your niche if possible (e.g., @[niche]analyst, @[niche]alpha)
- Consistent with your other handles if you're cross-platform

### Display Name
Your display name can include emojis and symbols. Common conventions in crypto CT:
- A flag emoji for your country (builds connection)
- An emoji indicating what you do: 📊 for analysts, 🏗️ for builders, 🧠 for thinkers
- Your affiliation if notable (e.g., "| [PROJECT NAME]")
- Keep it clean and readable

**Template:** `[Your Name] [Country Flag] [Role Emoji]`
**Example:** `Jae Park 🇰🇷 📊`

### Bio (160 characters)
Your bio needs to answer: "Why should I follow this person?"

**The formula:**
```
Line 1: What you do (specific, not generic)
Line 2: Your unique edge or credential (why should I trust you?)
Line 3: What I'll get if I follow (your content promise)
Line 4: Your link + CTA
```

**Examples:**

Bad bio:
> Crypto enthusiast | DeFi | NFTs | Trader | Sharing my journey 🚀

Good bio:
> On-chain data analyst. I find setups before they hit CT.
> Former quant, 7 years in crypto.
> Daily alpha threads + honest takes.
> Discord 👇

**Note:** The words "enthusiast," "journey," and "sharing" should never appear in a crypto bio. They signal "I have nothing specific to offer."

### Header Image
Your header is billboard-sized free real estate. Use it to:
- State your value proposition
- Show your content focus
- Display your brand colors
- Direct people to your Discord/Substack/community

Size: 1500x500px. Make it legible at thumbnail size.

### Pinned Tweet
Your pinned tweet is the most-viewed single tweet on your profile. It should be:
- Your best thread (one that got significant engagement)
- Your introduction thread (who you are, what you know, why follow)
- An offer (free resource, guide, template)

**Never pin:** A random hot take. An old tweet that did well but isn't relevant. A retweet of someone else's content.

---

## SECTION 2: POSTING SCHEDULE

### The Minimum Viable Schedule
If you can only do one thing: post 1 quality thread per week and engage daily in replies.

That's the minimum. Consistency matters more than frequency.

### The Optimal Schedule (5-10 hours/week)

**Daily (30 min):**
- 10 replies to relevant accounts in your niche
- 1-2 standalone tweets (observation, question, quick take)
- Engage with replies to your own content

**Weekly:**
- 2-3 threads (use templates from Part 1)
- 1 retweet with commentary of something valuable
- 1 "what are you thinking about?" question tweet

**Monthly:**
- 1 "reflection" thread (what you learned, where you're wrong, updates to your thesis)
- Review your top-performing content and double down on the type that performed

### Best Times to Post
For crypto Twitter specifically:

**Best times (EST):**
- 8:00-9:00 AM (morning commute / pre-market)
- 12:00-1:00 PM (lunch break)
- 5:00-7:00 PM (post-work)
- 9:00-11:00 PM (late scrollers)

**Best days:**
Monday-Thursday. Friday-Sunday engagement drops 20-30% on average.

**Exception:** If there's major news (protocol launch, market move, regulatory announcement), post immediately regardless of time. Timeliness trumps scheduling for news-adjacent content.

### Thread Timing Optimization
For threads specifically: post the hook tweet, then post the rest of the thread within 15 minutes. Don't space them out. Twitter's algorithm treats the whole thread as one piece of content and amplifies it based on engagement in the first hour.

---

## SECTION 3: ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### The Reply Strategy
Replies are the most underrated growth tactic in crypto Twitter. Here's how to do it right:

**Rule 1: Add information, not just agreement.**
"Great take" does nothing. "Great take — I'd add that the FDV angle here is especially important because [specific reason]" starts a conversation.

**Rule 2: Pick 10 accounts to be genuinely engaged with.**
Choose 10 people in your niche who are slightly larger than you but not untouchable. Engage meaningfully with their content every day. Genuine, consistent engagement from a thoughtful account gets noticed.

**Rule 3: Disagree publicly (politely).**
A thoughtful, specific disagreement in the replies of a large account gets enormous visibility. Do this when you genuinely disagree. Never do it as a stunt.

**Rule 4: Quote tweet > retweet.**
Retweeting adds nothing. Quote tweeting with your own take or analysis adds value to both the original and your profile.

### Building Relationships (Not Just Followers)
The accounts that grow fastest in crypto Twitter aren't just posting into the void — they're embedded in a network of mutual relationships with other creators.

**How to build this:**
1. When someone's content helps you, DM them and tell them specifically how
2. Tag relevant people in your threads when their work is related
3. Propose collabs (Twitter Spaces, mutual threads) when you've built enough relationship
4. Attend the same Twitter Spaces and be the person who asks good questions
5. Be known for saying good things about other people's work publicly

### The Follow-Back Dynamic
Follow anyone in your niche who:
- Has posted original research or threads you found valuable
- Engaged meaningfully with your content
- Is growing at a similar pace (potential collab partner)

Don't follow everyone who follows you. Your following list is a feed curation tool — keep it useful.

---

## SECTION 4: HOW TO GO VIRAL IN CRYPTO

### What "Viral" Actually Means
A thread with 1,000 retweets is not the goal. A thread that brings you 500 new followers who are genuinely interested in your content is the goal. Focus on follower quality, not vanity metrics.

That said, here's what actually makes threads spread:

### The Anatomy of a Viral Hook
Your first tweet (the hook) determines 80% of your reach. Here's the formula for hooks that make people stop:

**Pattern 1: The Counterintuitive Claim**
"[POPULAR BELIEF] is wrong. Here's the proof:"

**Pattern 2: The Specific Promise**
"I found [SPECIFIC THING] that most people don't know about [TOPIC]. Thread:"

**Pattern 3: The Story Opener**
"On [DATE], I [DRAMATIC THING HAPPENED]. Here's everything:"

**Pattern 4: The Number**
"[NUMBER] [THINGS] you need to know about [TOPIC] before [THING THAT CREATES URGENCY]:"

**Pattern 5: The Earned Credibility Statement**
"I've spent [TIME/EFFORT] analyzing [THING]. Here's what I found:"

### What Makes Threads Get Shared
1. **Teaches something genuinely useful** — people share things that make them look smart for sharing
2. **Confirms something people suspected but couldn't articulate** — validation threads spread fast
3. **Has great visual formatting** — bullet points, clean structure, easy to read quickly
4. **Ends with a conclusion that satisfies** — threads that build to a clear payoff get more retweets than threads that just... end
5. **Is honest about being wrong** — vulnerability in analysis threads is surprisingly shareable

### What Kills Threads
1. Weak hook — if the first tweet doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters
2. Too long — most threads should be 6-8 tweets. 15+ tweet threads lose people unless the topic demands it
3. No clear point — threads that meander without building to something get skimmed and abandoned
4. Generic fill-ins — using a template but filling it with generic phrases defeats the purpose
5. No call to action — not asking for the follow is leaving followers on the table

---

## SECTION 5: HOW TO TURN FOLLOWERS INTO BUYERS

### The Trust Funnel
Before someone buys from you, they need to:
1. Know you exist
2. Trust your expertise
3. Have a specific problem your product solves
4. Believe your product solves it better than alternatives

Your Twitter content builds 1 and 2. Your threads do the selling work for 3 and 4.

### The Content That Builds Buyers
The best content for driving purchases is:

**Educational content** — teaches something useful, positions you as an expert
**Behind-the-scenes** — shows your process, builds connection and trust
**Results content** — shows outcomes from your frameworks (case studies, before/after)
**Free value extraction** — gives part of your system away free; makes people want the rest

### How to Sell Without Being Annoying
The rule: never tweet about your product more than once every 10 tweets.

The way to do it:

**Technique 1: The natural mention**
"I break down exactly how I do [THING] in my [PRODUCT]. Here's the summary: [THREAD]. Full system in the link in bio."

**Technique 2: The outcome mention**
"Someone used [PRODUCT] and shared their result: [RESULT]. Still pinching myself."

**Technique 3: The social proof thread**
"I got [X messages] this week from people who [POSITIVE OUTCOME USING YOUR THING]. Here's what they said: [QUOTES]"

**Technique 4: The announcement thread**
When launching or relaunching: do a proper launch thread. One big push is better than constant low-grade promotion. Use Template D-style storytelling for launch threads.

### Pricing and Positioning via Twitter
Price your product in your bio or pinned tweet only if it's a key selling point. Otherwise, let the product page do that work. On Twitter, sell the transformation and the expert, not the price.

---

## SECTION 6: PROFILE AUDIT CHECKLIST

Run through this before posting your first thread:

**Profile:**
- [ ] Clear, high-quality profile photo
- [ ] Compelling bio that answers "why should I follow this person?"
- [ ] Header image that communicates value prop
- [ ] Display name is clean and readable
- [ ] Link in bio goes somewhere useful
- [ ] Pinned tweet is your best content

**Content preparation:**
- [ ] First 5 threads planned (using templates from Part 1)
- [ ] 10 accounts identified to engage with daily
- [ ] Posting schedule set (at minimum: 1 thread/week, daily replies)
- [ ] Content calendar for first 30 days

**The first 30 days goal:**
- 10 meaningful threads posted
- 300 quality replies left
- 10 genuine DMs sent to potential collab accounts
- 500 new followers (realistic target with consistent effort)
