## Brand Essence
PULSE is for people who know they have something to say on Twitter but don't know how to say it in a way that builds an audience. It's the bridge between "I have good ideas" and "10,000 people follow me because of those ideas."

The brand is electric, confident, and direct. Not a content farm — a craft shop. PULSE cares about quality: threads that are genuinely good, that people save and retweet because they're worth saving.

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Jae Park
**Background:** Former software engineer who started posting about crypto on Twitter as a hobby. Built an audience of 45,000 followers in 14 months without ads or influencer shoutouts — purely by mastering the craft of the thread. Grew 3 client accounts to 10K+ followers using the same system. Now sells the system.
**Voice:** Smart. Concise. Precise. Respects the reader's time.
**Beliefs:**
- "Your first tweet is an ad for the next one. Your whole thread is an ad for your profile."
- "The best threads solve a specific problem for a specific person. Everything else is content noise."
- "Engagement is a skill. It can be learned. It should be systematized."
- "You don't need to be the smartest person in the room. You need to be the clearest."

**Bio (for listings):**
> I went from 0 to 45,000 followers in 14 months on Crypto Twitter. Not because I got lucky, not because I paid for shoutouts — because I figured out exactly what kinds of threads get engagement and built a system around that. The templates in this pack are the ones I use every week.
