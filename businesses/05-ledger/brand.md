# LEDGER — Brand Identity

## Name
**LEDGER**

## Tagline
*"Your portfolio. Your proof."*

## Sub-tagline
Track everything. Decide better. Grow intentionally.

---

## Brand Essence
LEDGER is the tool for investors who take crypto seriously. Not a hype tool, not a trading bot - a clean, structured system for people who want to understand their portfolio at a glance, log every decision with intention, and review their performance with honesty.

The brand feels like a Bloomberg terminal crossed with a Moleskine notebook. Serious. Clean. Trustworthy.

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Marcus Wei
**Background:** Former quant analyst turned independent crypto investor. Managed a 7-figure portfolio through 2 bull markets and 2 crashes. Built this system after losing track of a significant position because he had no consistent tracking habit.
**Voice:** Direct. No hype. Numbers-first. Occasionally dry wit.
**Beliefs:**
- "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."
- "The investors who survive multiple cycles are the ones who journal their decisions."
- "A good portfolio tracker tells you what happened. A great one helps you understand WHY."

**Bio (for listings):**
> I've been trading crypto full-time since 2017. I've made a lot of money and I've given a lot of it back. The difference between my losing years and my winning years wasn't the market - it was my process. LEDGER is the system I wish I'd had on day one. Built for people who are serious about this.
