## FULL LISTING DESCRIPTION

### Stop Flying Blind With Your Crypto Portfolio

Most crypto investors have no idea what their actual returns are. They're spread across 6 exchanges, 4 wallets, and a mental model that hasn't been updated since the last bull run.

**LEDGER changes that.**

This is a complete Notion workspace that gives you total clarity on your portfolio - your positions, your trades, your research, and your decisions. All in one place. All organized.

### What's Inside

**📊 Portfolio Overview Database**
Your live holdings at a glance. Every position tracked with average cost basis, current value, P&L, and portfolio weight. Built-in formulas calculate your unrealized gains automatically. 5 different views including by category, by risk level, and a "needs review" filter so nothing slips through.

**📋 Trade Log**
Every buy, sell, and swap logged with execution price, fees, thesis, and outcome notes. Know your win rate. Know which trades were mistakes. Build a track record you can actually learn from.

**👀 Token Watchlist**
Research hub for tokens you're tracking but haven't bought. Fields for MC/FDV ratio, vesting status, entry target, risk factors, and competitive analysis. Never forget why you were interested in something.

**📓 Decision Journal**
The feature most portfolio tools don't have: a structured template for writing down WHY you made a trade before you make it. Thesis, opposing view, exit plan, risk assessment. Come back later and see if you were right.

**📅 Monthly Review Template**
A 30-minute end-of-month ritual that turns your raw trade data into actual insight. Performance snapshot, allocation review, market context, lessons learned, and next month's plan.

**📊 Command Center Dashboard**
One page with linked views of everything: your top holdings, recent trades, hot watchlist, and open decisions. Your portfolio's nerve center.

### Why $29?

One bad trade that you would have caught with proper journaling could cost you 10x this. One position you forgot about and couldn't track? 100x.

The cost of not tracking is much higher than $29. This template pays for itself the first time it saves you from an emotional trade.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it auto-update prices?**
No — Notion doesn't connect to live price feeds natively. You update prices manually (takes about 5 minutes per week). This is intentional: the act of manually reviewing prices forces you to engage with your portfolio actively, not just watch numbers move.

**Do I need a paid Notion account?**
The free Notion plan works fine for personal use. If you want to share or collaborate, you may need Notion's starter plan.

**Can I use it on mobile?**
Yes — Notion works on iOS and Android. The Dashboard and databases all work on mobile.

**What if I have 50+ tokens?**
It handles any number of positions. The filtered views actually become more useful the more positions you have.

**Can I customize it?**
Completely. Add your own properties, views, and databases. The template is a starting point, not a cage.
