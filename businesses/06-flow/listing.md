## FULL LISTING DESCRIPTION

### Your Community Is Your Moat. Are You Building It Right?

Every crypto project says "community first." Almost none of them actually know how to build one.

They launch a Discord, drop a link in a few Telegram groups, and wonder why 80% of their members are bots and ghost accounts. They host one AMA, get 12 attendees, and declare community "handled." They hire a community manager who posts GM every day and calls that engagement.

**The Crypto Community Growth Bible is different.**

This is a 10,000-word tactical playbook written by a community lead who's built multiple 100K+ member communities from scratch. It covers every phase of growth — from your first Discord setup to sustaining a 10,000-member ecosystem — with specific scripts, templates, and tactics you can use today.

### What's Inside

**Phase 1: 0 → 100 Members (The Foundation)**
Most communities get this phase catastrophically wrong. They spam invites, buy fake members, and end up with an empty server and a broken culture. This phase shows you:

- The exact Discord channel structure to start with (and why "more channels" is a death trap)
- How to manually recruit your first 50 members with a DM that actually works
- The Founding Member program that turns early joiners into champions
- The daily conversation tactic that makes a new Discord feel alive
- How to set up your Twitter profile and bio (template included) before you've even launched

**Phase 2: 100 → 1,000 Members (The Engine)**
This phase is about building the systems that let the community grow without you:

- How to run a community AMA that feels real (not a PR event)
- The Ambassador Program framework — turn your best members into your best marketers
- A complete weekly content calendar for both Discord and Twitter
- The partnership collab outreach DM that gets responses
- Retention tactics including the 7-day check-in system that reactivates 15% of inactive members
- A full moderation guide + Moderator Handbook template

**Phase 3: 1,000 → 10,000 Members (The Flywheel)**
When community-led growth takes over:

- Role tier structure for large communities (gated channels by contribution level)
- How to launch a community newsletter (template included)
- The big event playbook: Town Halls, Trading Competitions, Twitter Spaces
- KOL/influencer strategy that doesn't make you look desperate
- Building a content machine: community content programs, thread banks, media kits
- Incident response protocol for hacks, scams, and coordinated FUD attacks
- Moderation at scale: team structure and escalation framework

### Who This Is For

- Token founders about to launch and want to do community right from day one
- Project leads who have a Discord but it feels like a ghost town
- Community managers who are winging it and want a real system
- Growth leads who need a repeatable framework, not just vibes

---

### Why $47?

A community manager costs $3,000-8,000/month. A single bad community decision — botted numbers discovered, a poorly handled scam incident, a culture that drives away good members — can tank your project's reputation permanently.

This playbook is 47 dollars. It will tell you what to do, when to do it, and what to say. It's one of the most asymmetric purchases you can make for your project.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this for new projects or existing ones?**
Both. The Phase 1 content is perfect for launches. If you're already at 500 members, jump to Phase 2. The content is designed to be useful wherever you are.

**Does this cover Telegram too?**
The playbook focuses on Discord + Twitter/X as the primary platforms (the standard for most Web3 projects). The principles apply to Telegram, but the specific templates are Discord-first.

**Is this updated for 2024/2025?**
Yes. All tactics reflect current platform behavior, algorithm changes, and what's actually working in crypto communities right now.

**Do I need a token already?**
No. The early phases are specifically designed for pre-token projects. Community before token is the recommended approach.
