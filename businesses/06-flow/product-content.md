# FLOW — The Crypto Community Growth Bible
## Complete Playbook

**Version:** 1.0  
**Price:** $47  
**By:** Sofia Ramos, Community Lead

# INTRODUCTION

Let me be direct with you.

Most crypto community guides are written by people who've never actually built a community. They'll tell you to "be authentic" and "post consistently" and "engage with your members." That's not a playbook. That's a fortune cookie.

This guide is different.

Everything in here is specific. There are scripts, templates, exact schedules, numbers, and real tactics from real community builds. I'm going to tell you what to do, what to avoid, when to do it, and why it matters.

Community is the only moat in crypto that can't be forked. A competitor can copy your tokenomics. They can hire your developers. They can't steal your community's trust.

Let's build something real.

---

# HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

This guide is split into three phases:
- **Phase 1:** 0 → 100 members (the foundation)
- **Phase 2:** 100 → 1,000 members (the engine)
- **Phase 3:** 1,000 → 10,000 members (the flywheel)

Each phase covers:
- What to focus on
- What to avoid
- Specific tactics (numbered, actionable)
- Scripts and templates you can use today
- Metrics to track
- When to move to the next phase

**Important:** Don't skip phases. The mistake most founders make is jumping to Phase 3 tactics (paid growth, influencer deals, big events) before they've built the foundation. You'll get numbers but no engagement. You'll have 10,000 members and 12 daily active users.

---

# PHASE 1: 0 TO 100 MEMBERS

## The Mindset Shift

At 0-100, you are not building a community. You are building a *culture*. Every person who joins right now will define what your community becomes. They'll set the tone, establish the norms, and either attract or repel the next 900 people.

Be more selective than you think you should be. Quality over quantity, always.

---

## Discord Setup: Your Home Base

### Channel Structure (Start with THIS, not more)

```
📢 ANNOUNCEMENTS
├── #announcements (post-only)
└── #updates (weekly update thread)

💬 COMMUNITY
├── #general (main chat)
├── #introductions (new member intros)
└── #off-topic (memes, vibe, casual)

🔍 PROJECT
├── #about (pinned info about your project)
├── #roadmap (what you're building)
└── #faq (pinned answers to common questions)

💡 ALPHA
├── #research (member-shared research)
└── #signals (trading signals, discussion)

🛠️ SUPPORT
└── #help (questions, support tickets)
```

**Rule #1: Start with fewer channels, not more.** An empty Discord with 20 channels feels like a ghost town. A Discord with 5 active channels feels alive. You can add channels later. You cannot remove them without friction.

---

### Essential Bots to Install

1. **MEE6 or Carl-bot** — Role assignment, welcome messages, moderation
2. **Dyno** — Auto-moderation (spam links, caps filter)
3. **Atlas** — Community analytics (who's active, trending topics)
4. **YAGPDB** — Reaction roles for channel access tiers

**Do NOT install:** Too many bots at once. Every bot that breaks creates a bad first impression.

---

### Welcome Message Template

Set this up in your welcome channel (auto-sent by MEE6 when someone joins):

```
👋 Welcome to [PROJECT NAME], [USERNAME]!

You've just joined [1-line description of what your project does].

**Get started:**
📌 Read #about to understand what we're building
🙋 Introduce yourself in #introductions
💬 Jump into #general — we don't bite

**Quick rules:**
✅ Be respectful. Be curious. Add value.
❌ No spam, no scams, no shilling other projects
❌ No DM soliciting — report it and we'll ban immediately

Questions? Drop them in #help.

Glad you're here. 🌊
```

---

### #introductions Channel Pinned Message

```
**Introduce yourself! Here's a template to get started:**

---
👋 **Name/Handle:** 
🌍 **Where you're from:** 
💼 **What you do:** 
🔮 **What brought you to [PROJECT]:** 
🤙 **What you're hoping to find here:** 

---

We read every intro. Welcome!
```

---

### Your Server Rules (Pin These)

```
# Community Rules

1. **Be human.** Treat everyone here like a real person you respect.
2. **No spam.** No unsolicited links, no repeated messages, no channel flooding.
3. **No scams.** If you DM someone to sell them something, you're gone. Forever.
4. **Do your own research.** Nothing shared here is financial advice.
5. **No FUD without facts.** Skepticism is fine. Baseless FUD is not.
6. **No shill zone.** Don't promote other projects in our channels without permission.
7. **English in main channels.** Translations welcome in your language's thread.
8. **Respect the mods.** They're human. They make calls. Final is final.

Breaking rules = warning → timeout → ban.
The team reserves the right to remove anyone who damages community culture.
```

---

## Phase 1 Tactics

### Tactic 1: Manual Outreach (Yes, Manual)
Your first 50 members should be hand-invited. Not spam blasted. Go through:
- Your personal network on Twitter/X — who follows you? DM the relevant ones.
- Relevant Discord servers — engage genuinely, then mention your project in bio
- Reddit communities (r/CryptoCurrency, r/ethfinance, niche subreddits) — post thoughtfully, answer questions, don't spam
- Telegram groups in your niche
- LinkedIn if your project has a professional angle

**The DM that works:**
```
Hey [NAME], I saw your [tweet/post/comment] about [TOPIC] — really good take.

I'm building [ONE SENTENCE ABOUT PROJECT]. We just opened our Discord and I'm being selective about who I invite early — looking for people who care about [NICHE].

Would you be interested in joining? Zero spam, no hype BS, just a small group of people working through this stuff seriously.

[DISCORD LINK]
```

**What doesn't work:** Mass DMs with no personalization. Don't do it.

---

### Tactic 2: The Founding Member Program
Create a "Founding Member" role for your first 100 members. Give them:
- A special Discord role with a unique badge
- Their name in your "Founding Members" shout-out post
- Early access to features/announcements
- The feeling of being part of something before it was big

Announce it like this:
```
🌱 FOUNDING MEMBER PROGRAM

The first 100 people to join [PROJECT] Discord and introduce themselves get the 🏆 Founding Member role — forever.

This role comes with:
→ Exclusive channels and early alpha
→ Permanent recognition as a builder of this community
→ Snapshot eligibility for future token events

Only 100 spots. Join before they're gone.

[DISCORD LINK]
```

---

### Tactic 3: Be Visibly Active
For the first 2 weeks, someone from your team (or you) needs to respond to EVERY message in your Discord within 2 hours. Every single one.

This is non-negotiable at this stage. It signals: *"Real people built this. They care."*

Nothing kills an early community faster than unanswered messages.

---

### Tactic 4: The Daily Thread
Every day in #general, post a conversation starter. Not an announcement. A question.

Examples:
- "What's one protocol you've been impressed by this week and why?"
- "Unpopular opinion time: which L1 is actually overrated?"
- "What's your biggest mistake in crypto that you'd warn others about?"
- "If you had to put your entire portfolio into one token for 2 years, what would it be?"

These threads generate conversation, help you understand your audience, and give new members something to engage with immediately.

---

### Tactic 5: Twitter/X Bio + Profile Setup

Set this up before inviting anyone:

**Profile Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Profile photo (logo for project account, or clear face photo for personal)
- [ ] Header image (brand banner with project name and tagline)
- [ ] Bio: see template below
- [ ] Website link: to your Discord or landing page
- [ ] Location: optional, or put your chain (e.g., "On-chain")
- [ ] Pinned tweet: your project intro thread

**Twitter Bio Template:**
```
Building [what you're building] on [chain] 🌊
[One sharp benefit statement]
[Social proof or traction if you have it]
[Specific audience callout]
Discord 👇
```

**Example:**
```
Building the first decentralized yield optimizer for Solana 🌊
Turn your idle SOL into a passive income machine
$2M TVL | 1,400 users | Series A coming
For DeFi traders who are tired of leaving money on the table
Discord 👇
```

---

## What to AVOID in Phase 1

❌ **Don't buy Discord members.** Fake accounts tank your engagement rate and make your community feel dead to real people.

❌ **Don't post too much in #announcements.** Every announcement should matter. If you announce every minor update, people stop reading them.

❌ **Don't set up a token channel yet.** You don't have a token yet (probably). Don't create speculation you can't control.

❌ **Don't add too many channels.** We cannot stress this enough. A Discord with empty channels looks abandoned.

❌ **Don't ignore bad behavior.** The first time someone is aggressive or spammy, remove them visibly. Set the standard early. Weak moderation in Phase 1 creates culture problems you'll fight forever.

---

## Phase 1 Twitter Content Strategy

**Posting frequency:** 1x per day minimum, 3x per day maximum

**Content mix:**
- 40% Educational (teach people about your niche)
- 30% Behind the scenes (what you're building, decisions you're making)
- 20% Engagement (questions, polls, hot takes)
- 10% Community highlights (shout out active members, cool contributions)

**Don't launch yet.** You're building an audience of people who are interested in your niche, not just your project. When you do launch, they'll be warm.

---

## Phase 1 Metrics

Track these weekly:
| Metric | Target at 100 members |
|--------|----------------------|
| Discord members | 100 |
| Daily active users | 20+ (20% of total) |
| Messages per day | 30+ |
| Intro posts filled out | 60%+ |
| Response time to questions | < 2 hours |
| Twitter followers | 200+ |
| Twitter engagement rate | 3%+ |

**When to move to Phase 2:** When you have 80+ real, engaged members (not ghost accounts) and consistent daily conversation happening without you starting it.

---

# PHASE 2: 100 TO 1,000 MEMBERS

## The Mindset Shift

Phase 2 is about building the engine. You've proven the community can exist. Now you need to make it grow on its own. The goal is: members bring in other members.

Community-led growth is the most efficient marketing in crypto. When your members love the community, they talk about it. They share threads. They bring their friends.

Your job in Phase 2: create the conditions for that to happen.

---

## Phase 2 Discord Additions

Once you hit 100 members and daily conversation is consistent, add these channels:

```
Added in Phase 2:
├── #price-talk (isolate price discussion here so it doesn't flood general)
├── #governance (if applicable — proposals, votes)
├── #partnerships (community-submitted partner projects you've vetted)
├── #community-calls (announcements for voice calls, AMAs)
├── #media-kit (logos, brand assets for community content creators)
├── 🌍 REGIONAL SECTIONS
│   ├── #chinese (or whatever your top non-English community is)
│   └── #spanish
```

**Add a "Contributors" role** for members who consistently add value:
- Share good research
- Answer questions helpfully
- Create content about your project
- Run community events

Reward them visibly. Tag them in announcements. They're your core team without the payroll.

---

## Tactic 6: The Community AMA

Run your first AMA at ~200 members. This is a huge culture moment.

**Format:** Voice channel in Discord, 45-60 minutes, text Q&A in a dedicated channel.

**Prep checklist:**
- [ ] Announce 5 days in advance
- [ ] Collect questions in advance in #ama-questions
- [ ] Prepare 10 strong answers to likely questions
- [ ] Have a moderator handle the queue
- [ ] Record and share a text summary after

**AMA Announce Template:**
```
🎙️ COMMUNITY AMA — [DATE & TIME]

Got questions about what we're building, where we're going, or what the team is actually like?

Join us this [DAY] at [TIME UTC] in the 🎤 Community Voice channel.

Drop your questions in #ama-questions and the best ones get answered live.

This isn't a PR event. We'll answer the hard questions.

[Calendar link / Add to Google Calendar]
```

---

## Tactic 7: The Ambassador Program

At 300+ members, create an Ambassador Program. This formalizes what your best community members are already doing.

**Ambassador Criteria:**
- Active member for 30+ days
- Has shared helpful content or answered questions consistently
- Believes in the project's mission
- Willing to represent the community online

**Ambassador Benefits:**
- Exclusive #ambassador-lounge channel
- Early access to news and content
- Official "Ambassador" role
- Compensation (allocation in token airdrop, monthly small stipend if budget allows, or merch)
- Co-created content opportunities

**Ambassador Application Template:**
```
**AMBASSADOR APPLICATION**

Handle: 
Discord username: 
Twitter: 
How long have you been in our community?
Why do you want to be an Ambassador?
What skills do you bring? (content creation, translation, development, etc.)
What's one thing you've already contributed to this community?
How many hours per week can you commit?
```

Target: 5-10 Ambassadors by 1,000 members. They'll do more for your growth than most paid marketing.

---

## Tactic 8: Weekly Content Calendar

Phase 2 requires consistency. Here's a weekly schedule that works:

**DISCORD (Weekly Calendar)**

| Day | Channel | Content |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Monday | #general | "Monday Motivation" — post a relevant market insight or question |
| Tuesday | #research | Share a research deep-dive on a relevant topic (thread format) |
| Wednesday | #announcements | Weekly update from the team (what happened, what's next) |
| Thursday | #general | "Throwback Thursday" — share a lesson or story from your journey |
| Friday | #general | "Friday Alpha" — one piece of useful signal for the community |
| Saturday | #off-topic | Community gaming event, trivia, meme contest |
| Sunday | #community-calls | Weekly voice call (30 min) — what's on everyone's mind |

**TWITTER (Weekly Calendar)**

| Day | Type | Example |
|-----|------|---------|
| Monday | Educational thread | "5 things most people don't know about [your niche]" |
| Tuesday | Behind the scenes | "Here's what we shipped this week and what broke" |
| Wednesday | Engagement | Hot take / question / poll |
| Thursday | Community spotlight | RT an ambassador's content, highlight a community member |
| Friday | Alpha / signal | One thing you're watching this week and why |
| Weekend | Reply-heavy | Get in replies. Engage with others. Build relationships. |

---

## Tactic 9: The Weekly Update Thread

Every Wednesday, post a structured update. This is one of the highest-leverage content habits you can build.

**Template:**
```
📡 [PROJECT] WEEKLY UPDATE — Week [#]

**SHIPPED THIS WEEK:**
→ 
→ 

**WORKING ON:**
→ 
→ 

**NUMBERS:**
→ TVL: 
→ Users: 
→ Community: [X] Discord members | [X] Twitter followers

**SPOTTED IN THE WILD:**
→ (something cool from the broader ecosystem worth noting)

**THIS WEEK'S QUESTION:**
→ [Ask the community something]

See you next week. 🌊
```

---

## Tactic 10: Partnership Collabs

At 300-500 members, start pursuing partnership collabs with complementary projects. 

**What to propose:**
- Co-hosted AMA (both communities benefit)
- Joint giveaway or event
- Cross-posting educational content
- Guest post in each other's newsletters/socials

**The Partnership Outreach DM:**
```
Hey [NAME], huge fan of what you're building at [PROJECT].

I run the community at [YOUR PROJECT] — we're at [X] Discord members and very aligned with your audience. Both of our communities are [describe overlap].

Would you be open to a co-hosted AMA or community event? Both teams get in front of relevant new audiences, no budget needed.

Let me know if you'd want to jump on a quick call.
```

Target: 2-3 partnerships per month in Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 Moderation Guide

As your community grows, moderation becomes a real job. Set up:

**Auto-moderation rules (Carl-bot or Dyno):**
- Block Discord invite links (except from mods)
- Block links to known scam sites
- Timeout users who post @everyone without permission
- Filter excessive caps (set to 70%+ caps triggers warning)
- Timeout users for repeated identical messages

**Human moderation:**
- Designate at least 2 moderators by 300 members
- Create a #mod-logs channel (private, team only) to track actions taken
- Ban policy: 1st offense = warning, 2nd = 24h timeout, 3rd = permanent ban (unless it's spam/scam = immediate permanent)
- Create a #report channel where members can flag issues

**Moderator Handbook (share this with your mods):**
```
MODERATOR PRINCIPLES

1. Always assume positive intent first. Most confusion is not malice.
2. Enforce rules consistently. Inconsistency destroys trust.
3. Never argue publicly with members. Handle escalations in DMs.
4. When in doubt, consult the team before acting.
5. Document everything in #mod-logs.
6. Take breaks. Moderation is emotionally taxing. You're human.
7. Your job is to protect the culture, not to control the conversation.
```

---

## Phase 2 Retention Strategies

Getting members is easy. Keeping them is the real work.

**Top retention tactics:**

1. **The 7-day check-in:** When someone hasn't posted in 7 days, have a bot (or mod) send them a friendly DM asking if they have any questions. This reactivates ~15% of inactive members.

2. **The contributor spotlight:** Every week, feature a community member who did something great. Post in #announcements: "This week's community MVP is @[handle] for [specific thing they did]. Go follow them."

3. **Progress updates:** Share real metrics with your community. When people feel like they're watching something grow, they stay. "We hit 500 members today. A year ago there were 3 of us. Thanks for being here."

4. **Community events that aren't just AMAs:**
   - Weekly trivia (crypto topics, use a trivia bot)
   - Trading competitions with small prizes
   - "Best portfolio screenshot" contests
   - Community-written content projects (collaborative research reports)
   - Voice hangouts (no agenda, just vibe)

5. **Earn rewards:** Give members ways to earn things for contributing. Points, roles, access, allocations. Make contribution feel rewarding, not just expected.

---

## Phase 2 Metrics

| Metric | Target at 1,000 members |
|--------|------------------------|
| Discord members | 1,000 |
| Daily active users | 150+ (15%) |
| Messages per day | 200+ |
| Weekly voice event attendance | 50+ |
| Ambassador program members | 5+ |
| Twitter followers | 2,000+ |
| Twitter engagement rate | 2%+ |
| Weekly update views | 200+ |
| Partnership collabs run | 3+ |

**When to move to Phase 3:** When you have organic growth happening without you driving it — new members coming from member referrals, your content being shared unprompted, and ambassadors actively representing you.

---

# PHASE 3: 1,000 TO 10,000 MEMBERS

## The Mindset Shift

Phase 3 is the flywheel. If you've done Phase 1 and Phase 2 right, things start to compound. New members come in because the community has a reputation. Content gets shared because it's genuinely valuable. The community builds itself.

Your job in Phase 3 shifts from "doing" to "enabling." You hire (or appoint) a dedicated community manager. You build systems. You create programs that run without you.

---

## Phase 3 Discord Structure

Time to tier your community with proper role structure:

**Role Tiers:**
```
👑 Core Team — internal team only
🌟 Founding Member — original 100 (keep this permanent)
💎 Ambassador — verified ambassadors
🔥 Contributor — active value-adders (auto-assigned by activity)
📈 Active Member — posted in last 30 days
🆕 New Member — default for anyone who joins
```

**Gated Channels by Role:**
```
💎 AMBASSADOR-ONLY
├── #ambassador-lounge (discussion)
├── #early-alpha (info before public release)
└── #strategy-input (give them a voice in decisions)

🔥 CONTRIBUTOR+
├── #inner-circle (high-signal discussion)
└── #research-deep-dive (serious research threads)

Everyone:
├── (all standard channels)
```

---

## Tactic 11: Launch a Community Newsletter

At 1,000+ members, launch a weekly community newsletter. This keeps members who aren't daily Discord users engaged, and it creates a content asset you own.

**Newsletter format (weekly, 400-600 words):**
```
THE FLOW LETTER — Week [#]

👋 WHAT'S NEW
[2-3 sentences on the biggest update this week]

🔬 DEEP DIVE
[A longer piece on a topic relevant to your community — original analysis or curated from the best content you found]

🌟 COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT
[Feature a member, ambassador, or contribution]

📊 THE NUMBERS
[Key metrics you're comfortable sharing]

📅 WHAT'S COMING
[Events, launches, or content in the next week]

🤝 CONNECT
[Discord link | Twitter | Website]
```

Use Paragraph.xyz, Substack, or Mirror if you want on-chain flair.

---

## Tactic 12: The Big Event Playbook

Phase 3 events should be bigger, more produced, and more community-owned.

**Event Types That Work at 1K+ Members:**

**1. Monthly Community Town Hall (AMA 2.0)**
- Full team on voice
- Pre-submitted + live questions
- Record and post as YouTube/podcast
- Target: 200+ live attendees

**2. Monthly Trading Competition**
- Partners with a DEX or platform for prize pool
- Community votes on format
- Leaderboard posted publicly
- Target: 100+ participants

**3. Community Research Report**
- Ambassadors collaborate on a research report
- Community submits insights and data
- Published to Twitter and pinned in Discord
- Creates content, recognition, and depth signal

**4. Twitter Spaces**
- Host 2x/month
- Invite 1-2 guests from relevant projects
- Promote 3 days in advance
- Target: 300+ listeners

**5. "Governance Day"**
- Once a quarter, hold a structured community vote on a real decision
- Even if you're centralized, the process creates ownership feeling
- Announce the result publicly and explain how the community input influenced it

---

## Tactic 13: Influencer and KOL Strategy

At Phase 3, you have the credibility to approach Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) properly.

**Do this:**
- Find KOLs who genuinely align with your niche (don't pay a Shiba Inu KOL to shill a DeFi protocol)
- Build relationships before asking for anything (engage with their content, add value to their discussions)
- Offer KOLs exclusive access or early alpha rather than just money
- Co-create content rather than just getting a shoutout

**The KOL Outreach Template:**
```
Hey [NAME],

I've been following your content on [topic] for a while — your take on [specific recent piece] was one of the most useful things I read this month.

I'm building [PROJECT] — [one sentence description]. We're at [X] Discord members and [Y] Twitter followers. Our community is genuinely engaged — [specific proof, e.g., "our weekly AMAs get 300+ live attendees"].

I'd love to explore a collab. Not a paid shill — I mean actual co-created content on [topic both audiences care about]. You'd get [specific benefit], we'd get [specific benefit].

No rush at all — just wanted to put it out there.

[Your name]
```

---

## Tactic 14: Content Machine

Phase 3 requires more content than one person can produce. Build a content machine:

**Systems to build:**

1. **Community Content Program:** Pay or reward members for creating content about your project. Set a template (thread structure, key talking points, required disclosures). Amplify the best ones from your main account.

2. **Thread Bank:** A Notion database of thread ideas, half-written threads, and past viral threads. Anyone on your team can pick one up and ship it.

3. **Media Kit:** Public folder with logos, screenshots, graphics. Lower the friction for anyone wanting to write about you.

4. **Press / Research Page:** A single page with key stats, team bios, and a contact for journalists. One journalist writing about you can bring hundreds of new members.

---

## Phase 3 Retention Strategies

At 10,000 members, active rate will naturally drop. Your goal isn't 100% engagement — it's a core of 500+ highly active members surrounded by thousands of warm ones.

**Retention at scale:**

1. **Graduation events:** When you hit milestones (2K, 5K, 10K), celebrate with community events. Make members feel like they built this.

2. **Memory-making:** The best communities have inside jokes, legendary moments, memorable events. Be intentional about creating these. A controversial AMA, an unexpected announcement, a crazy trade that worked out.

3. **Cross-chain visibility:** Expand to where your target audience lives. Telegram for Asian markets. LinkedIn for institutional angles. Never fully abandon a platform — just distribute effort.

4. **Mental model for retention:** Every member is asking "why should I come back tomorrow?" Your job is to ensure tomorrow always has an answer.

---

## Moderation at Scale

By 10,000 members, moderation is a professional function.

**Team structure:**
- 1 Community Manager (dedicated, paid, 20-40hrs/week)
- 3-5 Active Moderators (can be volunteer or lightly compensated)
- Ambassador layer as first line of culture defense

**Incident Response Protocol:**
```
INCIDENT LEVELS:

Level 1 (Low): Spam, single scam DM, minor rule break
→ Action: Warning or 24h timeout, log in #mod-logs
→ Who handles: Any moderator

Level 2 (Medium): Coordinated spam, doxxing attempt, serious FUD
→ Action: Immediate ban, post to #mod-logs with evidence
→ Who handles: Senior mod + notify CM

Level 3 (High): Coordinated attack, impersonation campaign, exchange hack rumor
→ Action: Lock relevant channels, emergency team call, public statement within 60 min
→ Who handles: Founders + CM immediate response

RULE: Every Level 2+ incident gets a post-mortem within 48 hours.
What happened. What we did. What we're doing to prevent it.
```

# APPENDIX C: THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF CRYPTO COMMUNITY BUILDING

1. **Culture before size.** 100 engaged believers beat 10,000 ghost accounts every time.

2. **Show up daily.** Consistency builds trust faster than any single viral moment.

3. **Answer every question.** Especially early on. Unanswered questions become doubts.

4. **Celebrate the community.** It's not your community. It's theirs. Act like it.

5. **Be honest about setbacks.** If something breaks or a launch gets delayed, say so first. Your community forgives honesty. They don't forgive silence.

6. **Moderate with values.** Remove bad actors fast and publicly. Set the standard.

7. **Never buy fake members.** The short-term number isn't worth the long-term reputation damage.

8. **Let the community lead sometimes.** The best communities have grassroots initiatives from members, not just top-down content from founders.

9. **Your community is your moat.** When the market turns bear and the fair-weather holders leave, your core community stays. Invest in them accordingly.

10. **Play long-term games.** Community is a 3-year asset. Don't sacrifice trust for a short-term growth hack.
