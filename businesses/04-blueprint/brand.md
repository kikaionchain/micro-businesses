# BLUEPRINT — Brand Identity

---

## Name
**BLUEPRINT**

## Tagline
*"Build a brand worth believing in."*

---

## Brand Concept
BLUEPRINT is the brand identity resource that crypto projects reach for when they're tired of looking like every other gradient-heavy, neon-soaked project in the space. It's design-forward but accessible — built for founders who know they need to look professional but don't have a design team. The name works on multiple levels: architectural plans, technical documentation, and a "blueprint" for replication. It signals precision and craft.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Deep Navy | `#0B1221` |
| Secondary | Pure White | `#FFFFFF` |
| Accent | Antique Gold | `#C9A84C` |

**Usage notes:**
- Deep Navy is the brand base — serious, premium, architectural
- Pure White provides the primary contrast — clean, minimal
- Antique Gold is the elevation layer — section markers, borders, key titles, premium accents. Applied sparingly. One gold element makes everything around it look more expensive.

**Why this palette:**
Most crypto projects default to neon/gradient palettes. BLUEPRINT occupies a different position — it looks like a premium financial tool or a high-end design studio. The navy/white/gold combination has worked in luxury branding for decades. It works here because it's different from what surrounds it.

## Typography Direction

**Primary:** **Canela** or **Domaine Display** — editorial serif for headlines. This creates the "we take design seriously" signal in a single typeface choice.

**Secondary:** **Suisse Int'l** or **Neue Montreal** — clean, neutral grotesque for body text and functional information.

**Mono accent:** **Commit Mono** or **Fira Code** — for hex codes, code references, and data. Adds technical credibility.

**Rule:** The contrast between editorial serif headlines and functional sans-serif body is the entire typographic system. Don't add a third typeface.

## Tone of Voice

- **Design-literate, not design-snobby.** BLUEPRINT knows what it's talking about but doesn't talk down to founders who don't.
- **Precise.** If something looks a specific way for a reason, BLUEPRINT states the reason.
- **Decisive.** "Use this, not that" — not "here are some options, you decide." Founders want decisions made for them on design.
- **Aspirational without hype.** The promise is professional credibility, not viral fame.

**Example of on-brand copy:**
> "Eighty percent of crypto projects use blue. Use something specific instead. Here are five complete palettes built for projects that want to be remembered."

**Example of off-brand copy:**
> "Express your creative vision with our amazing collection of design resources! Stand out from the crowd with stunning visuals!"

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Zoe Carver
**Handle:** @zoecarver_co
**Bio:** Zoe is a brand designer with 8 years of experience — 5 of those in crypto after getting dragged into the space by a client in 2019. She's designed brands for a dozen projects, from NFT collections to DeFi protocols. She charges $8k-$15k for a full brand project. She built BLUEPRINT because founders kept asking her for "just the fundamentals" at a price that wasn't $10k. BLUEPRINT is the answer to that question. She still takes two full-brand clients per year. Everything else she teaches.

**Persona notes:**
- Has a real design portfolio — the brand identity itself demonstrates the product works
- Posts occasionally on design for crypto on X and Substack
- Very occasional; the work speaks for itself
- Uses the product herself for client onboarding

## Brand Applications

- **Document design:** Navy background or white background depending on section. Gold section numbers. Serif headlines. Clean tabular layouts for color and type data.
- **Hex code presentation:** Always shown in both HEX and RGB. Displayed on a background swatch to demonstrate appearance in context.
- **Typography specimens:** Show each typeface at multiple weights and sizes — not just stated, but demonstrated in sample copy.
