## 5 Bullet Points: What's Included

- **5 complete color system palettes** — "The Protocol" (DeFi/finance), "The Genesis" (L1/L2 chains), "The Community" (DAOs/governance), "The Challenger" (NFT/gaming), and "The Founder" (early-stage/versatile). Each includes primary, secondary, accent, neutral, and background colors with hex codes, RGB values, and guidance on where to use every color.

- **5 typography pairing guides** — Complete type combinations for every project type: authority/financial, technical/developer, community/warm, disruptive/bold, and editorial. Each includes font names (with free alternatives), usage rules, size guidance, and a full visual specimen showing each combination in action.

- **Logo direction worksheet** — A complete designer brief template covering logo type selection, personality sliders, visual criteria, what to avoid, and a summary brief. Hand this to any designer or AI design tool and get a logo that's actually right for your project.

- **Social media sizing guide + Canva setup guide** — Correct dimensions for every platform (profile images, banners, post formats, story sizes) with safe zone guidance. Includes a step-by-step Canva brand kit setup so your whole team posts consistently from day one.

- **Pitch deck outline + one-pager + brand voice system** — 12-slide pitch deck with specific guidance for each slide. A one-pager template with a copy framework that replaces vague descriptions with specific language. A brand voice worksheet with the 4-attribute model, vocabulary guide, and application rules.

## FAQ (3 Questions)

**Q: Do I need design software to use this?**
A: No. BLUEPRINT is brand strategy and direction — everything you need to either implement yourself (using free tools like Canva, which this kit has a setup guide for) or hand to a designer or AI tool as a brief. No Figma, Photoshop, or Illustrator required. The color codes, font names, and worksheets work as starting points for any design tool.

**Q: Is this for established projects or early-stage founders?**
A: Both. Early-stage founders use BLUEPRINT to establish their brand from scratch — the worksheets guide you through every decision. Established projects use it to audit and upgrade an inconsistent brand. The 5 color palettes and type pairings are reusable across projects, so teams and agencies often find it valuable across multiple builds.

**Q: How is this different from just using a Canva template?**
A: Canva templates give you a visual layout. BLUEPRINT gives you the strategy underneath the visuals — why to use specific colors for specific project types, how to brief a logo designer, what your brand voice should sound like, how your pitch deck should be structured. The visual execution is yours to do however you like; BLUEPRINT is the thinking that makes that execution coherent and professional.
