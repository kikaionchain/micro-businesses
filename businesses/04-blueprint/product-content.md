# BLUEPRINT — Web3 Brand Starter Kit
### Complete Brand Identity System for Crypto Projects

---

> *"Design isn't decoration. It's communication. Every visual choice you make tells your audience something about whether you're worth trusting."*

**How to use this kit:**
Work through each section in order. By the end, you'll have: a complete color system, a typography direction, a logo brief ready for a designer, a social media setup guide, a pitch deck you can build from, a one-pager, and a brand voice system. None of this requires design software — this is brand strategy and direction, ready for you to implement or hand to a designer.

# SECTION 1: COLOR SYSTEMS
## 5 Complete Palettes for Crypto Projects

*Each palette includes: primary color, secondary, accent, supporting neutral, and dark/light variants. Hex codes included. Usage guidance provided. Pick one palette and use it consistently.*

---

## PALETTE 01 — "THE PROTOCOL"
*For: DeFi protocols, infrastructure projects, serious financial tools*
*Personality: Authoritative, trustworthy, institutional*

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Primary | Deep Navy | `#0B1221` | 11, 18, 33 |
| Secondary | Steel Blue | `#1E3A5F` | 30, 58, 95 |
| Accent | Antique Gold | `#C9A84C` | 201, 168, 76 |
| Neutral | Slate Gray | `#6B7280` | 107, 114, 128 |
| Light Base | Off White | `#F8F7F4` | 248, 247, 244 |
| Dark Mode BG | True Black | `#070B14` | 7, 11, 20 |

**Using this palette:**
- Deep Navy as background for hero sections, headers, primary UI
- Steel Blue as secondary surfaces, card backgrounds, hover states
- Antique Gold sparingly: CTAs, dividers, highlighted numbers, awards/milestones
- Slate Gray for body text, labels, inactive states
- Off White for light mode backgrounds and text on dark surfaces
- True Black for premium dark mode applications

**What this says:** You're building something that handles real money. You understand gravity. You're not trying to look exciting — you're trying to look reliable.

**Works well for:** Lending protocols, DEX platforms, treasury management tools, infrastructure layers

---

## PALETTE 02 — "THE GENESIS"
*For: New L1/L2 chains, base layer infrastructure, ecosystem foundations*
*Personality: Expansive, technological, foundational*

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Primary | Midnight | `#0D0D0D` | 13, 13, 13 |
| Secondary | Deep Violet | `#1A0A2E` | 26, 10, 46 |
| Accent | Electric Indigo | `#6610F2` | 102, 16, 242 |
| Secondary Accent | Cosmic Teal | `#00D4AA` | 0, 212, 170 |
| Neutral | Carbon | `#2D2D2D` | 45, 45, 45 |
| Light | Warm White | `#FAFAFA` | 250, 250, 250 |

**Using this palette:**
- Midnight as the foundation — everything lives on dark
- Deep Violet for background depth — subtle, creates dimension
- Electric Indigo as the primary brand color: logos, primary buttons, key highlights
- Cosmic Teal as the secondary accent: status indicators, positive states, success colors
- Never use both accents together at full opacity — creates visual chaos
- Carbon for secondary surfaces and card backgrounds

**What this says:** You're building at the base layer. You're thinking in systems, not products. The color depth signals technological ambition.

**Works well for:** New blockchain networks, zero-knowledge proof systems, cross-chain infrastructure, developer platforms

---

## PALETTE 03 — "THE COMMUNITY"
*For: DAOs, governance platforms, community-first projects*
*Personality: Warm, inclusive, human, approachable*

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Primary | Forest | `#1A3A2A` | 26, 58, 42 |
| Secondary | Sage | `#4A7C59` | 74, 124, 89 |
| Accent | Citrus | `#F2B705` | 242, 183, 5 |
| Warm Neutral | Cream | `#FAF3E0` | 250, 243, 224 |
| Dark | Earth | `#2C1810` | 44, 24, 16 |
| Soft White | `#FEFCF8` | 254, 252, 248 |

**Using this palette:**
- Forest as the grounding color — authority without coldness
- Sage for secondary elements, hover states, supporting visuals
- Citrus as the energy injection — community calls to action, member recognition, vote indicators
- Cream for warm light mode backgrounds — NOT pure white; the warmth matters here
- Earth for typography on light backgrounds where navy would feel too corporate

**What this says:** This project is built around people, not technology. The warmth of the palette signals that participation matters here. You're building a community, not acquiring users.

**Works well for:** DAOs, social protocols, community treasury projects, regenerative finance, public goods

---

## PALETTE 04 — "THE CHALLENGER"
*For: NFT projects, gaming/metaverse, creator economy, bold new concepts*
*Personality: Bold, energetic, disruptive, visually distinct*

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Primary | Jet | `#1C1C1C` | 28, 28, 28 |
| Accent 1 | Acid Yellow | `#E8FF00` | 232, 255, 0 |

| Accent 3 | Electric Blue | `#0066FF` | 0, 102, 255 |
| Neutral | Ash | `#888888` | 136, 136, 136 |
| Light | Chalk | `#F5F5F0` | 245, 245, 240 |

**Using this palette:**
- Jet as the canvas — dark, neutral, lets the accents pop completely
- ONE accent per communication piece — don't mix all three
  - Acid Yellow: primary state, current project, "live now"
  - Hot Magenta: event/drop/launch moments, urgency
  - Electric Blue: information, links, secondary state
- Ash for neutral supporting text and inactive states
- The power of this palette is restraint: one accent at a time

**What this says:** You know what you're doing. The bold palette signals confidence and creative authority. Projects that pull this off look like they're driving culture, not following it.

**Works well for:** NFT collections, gaming projects, creator platforms, generative art, culture-forward DAOs

---

## PALETTE 05 — "THE FOUNDER"
*For: Early-stage projects, personal brands, solo builders, stealth projects*
*Personality: Clean, credible, versatile, unfussy*

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| Primary | Near Black | `#111111` | 17, 17, 17 |
| Secondary | Mid Gray | `#666666` | 102, 102, 102 |
| Accent | Signal Red | `#E63946` | 230, 57, 70 |
| Alt Accent | Signal Blue | `#457B9D` | 69, 123, 157 |
| Light | Pure White | `#FFFFFF` | 255, 255, 255 |
| Background | Soft Gray | `#F4F4F4` | 244, 244, 244 |

**Using this palette:**
- Near Black + White is the skeleton — clean, high contrast, works everywhere
- Mid Gray for secondary content, metadata, supporting text
- Signal Red OR Signal Blue as your single accent — pick one and commit
  - Red: for urgency, calls to action, important announcements
  - Blue: for trust signals, institutional contexts, calm communication
- Soft Gray as background when pure white feels too clinical

**What this says:** You're building something real and you know it. This palette signals that you're not trying to distract from substance with style. It's for projects where the idea carries the weight.

**Works well for:** Pre-launch projects, research/analytics tools, B2B crypto tools, solo founders, serious journalism/publication projects

# SECTION 2: TYPOGRAPHY PAIRING GUIDE
## 5 Type Combinations for Crypto Projects

*For each pairing: headline typeface, body typeface, how to use them, and a specimen showing them in action.*

---

## PAIRING 01 — "THE AUTHORITY"
*For: Financial tools, serious protocols, anything that needs to feel institutional*

**Headline:** Playfair Display (Serif) — Heavy or Black weight
**Body:** Inter — Regular for paragraphs, Medium for labels
**Accent/Mono:** JetBrains Mono for code, contracts, addresses

**How to use:**
- Playfair Display headlines at 48px+ — don't use it small, it loses its impact
- Inter body at 16-18px, 1.6-1.8 line height — generous spacing signals quality
- Reserve JetBrains Mono exclusively for technical content (addresses, hashes, contract code)
- Never use Playfair Display in all-caps — designed for title case

**Specimen:**

```
[HEADLINE] Your Protocol, Secured
[Playfair Display Black, 64px]

[SUBHEADING] Trustless. Audited. Live on Mainnet.
[Inter Medium, 24px]

[BODY] We believe that financial infrastructure should be
transparent, secure, and available to everyone. That's why
everything we build is open source and audited before deployment.
[Inter Regular, 17px]

[MONO] Contract: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e

```

**Pairs with:** Palette 02 (THE GENESIS) or Palette 05 (THE FOUNDER)

---

## PAIRING 03 — "THE COMMUNITY"
*For: DAOs, governance, social platforms, community-first projects*

**Headline:** Fraunces — Heavy or Black (variable font with optical sizing)
**Body:** Lato — Regular with Bold for emphasis
**Accent:** Nunito for community labels, badges, casual UI elements

**How to use:**
- Fraunces is distinctly warm for a serif — it has personality that makes text feel personal
- Use Fraunces for member names, community milestones, welcome messages
- Lato is maximally readable and neutral — the body text disappears, which is right for community content
- Nunito adds rounded, approachable energy for badges, tags, and UI labels

**Specimen:**

```
[HEADLINE] A Community Worth Being Part Of
[Fraunces Black, 52px]

[SUBHEADING] Built by members. Governed by members. For everyone.

```
[HEADLINE] The State of Decentralized Finance: Q4 2025
[Libre Baskerville Bold, 44px]

[SUBHEADING] A quarterly analysis of on-chain activity,
protocol revenues, and ecosystem health.
[Source Serif 4 Regular Italic, 20px]

[BODY] The fourth quarter of 2025 presented a complex
picture for DeFi. While total value locked across major
protocols reached new highs, fee revenue told a different
story — one of concentrated usage and platform consolidation.
[Source Serif 4 Regular, 16px, 1.8 line height]

[DATA REF] Source: DeFi Llama, Dune Analytics (accessed Dec 2025)
[Source Code Pro Regular, 12px]
```

**Pairs with:** Palette 01 (THE PROTOCOL) or Palette 05 (THE FOUNDER)

**How it's pronounced:** [PHONETIC — e.g., "Aye-thee" not "Ath-ee"]

**Does the name have a meaning or etymology?**
[ ] Yes — explain: _______________
[ ] No — it was chosen for: [sound / feel / availability / other]

**Describe your project in one sentence without using "decentralized," "trustless," or "revolutionary":**
> _______________

**Who is your primary user?**
> _______________

**Name 3 brands (any industry) whose visual identity you admire:**
1. [Brand + what you like about their logo specifically]
2. [Brand + what you like]
3. [Brand + what you like]

---

## PART B: Visual Direction

**Logo type — which do you prefer?** (Check all that are acceptable; circle your first choice)

[ ] **Wordmark** — Just the name in a specific typeface (e.g., Google, FedEx)
[ ] **Lettermark** — Just initials (e.g., IBM, HBO)
[ ] **Symbol mark** — Just an icon (e.g., Apple, Twitter)
[ ] **Combination mark** — Name + icon together (most common, most flexible)
[ ] **Emblem** — Name contained within a badge or shield (e.g., Harley Davidson)

**Why you chose what you chose:**
> _______________

---

## PART C: Personality Sliders

*For each pair, mark where your brand sits on the spectrum (1 = fully left, 10 = fully right):*

```
Formal          [1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10]    Casual
Technical       [1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10]    Human

[ ] Feel timeless (could work in 10 years)

**The logo SHOULD NOT:**
[ ] Use gradients (gradients are hard to reproduce in print/embroidery)
[ ] Reference existing crypto project logos
[ ] Use generic imagery (shields, chains, rockets, flames, coins)
[ ] Require more than 3 colors to render correctly
[ ] Rely on fine details that disappear at small sizes

---

## PART E: What to Avoid

**Logos we specifically do not want to look like:**
> [List 3-5 specific projects or styles to avoid and why]

**Visual clichés we're avoiding:**
[ ] Hexagons

# SECTION 5: PITCH DECK OUTLINE
## 12-Slide Structure for Crypto Projects

*For each slide: purpose, what to include, what to avoid, and length guidance.*

---

**SLIDE 1 — Cover**

*Purpose: Make a strong first impression. Establish context immediately.*

Include:
- Project name and logo (prominently)
- One-line description (under 10 words — what do you actually do)
- "Confidential" if appropriate
- Date and presenter name

Avoid: Excessive visual complexity. Animations. Generic stock imagery.

**Design note:** This slide will be on screen while you introduce yourself. It should be clean enough to not compete with you speaking.

---

**SLIDE 2 — The Problem**

*Purpose: Make the investor feel the problem before you explain your solution.*

Include:
- One specific, concrete problem statement (not vague "DeFi is broken")
- Data that quantifies the problem (market size, frequency, cost)
- Who experiences this problem (your specific user)
- Why existing solutions fail

Avoid: Multiple problems. Vague statements without data.

**Length:** 100-150 words max on the slide itself. You explain the rest verbally.

**Design note:** Data visualization of the problem is more powerful than paragraph text.

---

**SLIDE 3 — The Market**

*Purpose: Demonstrate that the problem is big enough to warrant the investment.*

Include:
- TAM (Total Addressable Market): the total market if you captured everything
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): the realistic target market
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): what you can realistically capture
- Source for each number (credibility)
- Growth trajectory of the market

Avoid: Inflated numbers without sources. Claiming you'll capture 1% of a trillion-dollar market without explanation.

**Design note:** A simple chart showing market size over time is more compelling than static numbers alone.

---

**SLIDE 4 — The Solution**

*Purpose: Show them what you built.*

Include:
- Clear, jargon-free description of what your product does
- Screenshot, demo, or mockup (even wireframes are better than no visuals)
- The mechanism: how does it work in plain language
- Why your approach is better than alternatives

Avoid: Technical depth that an investor can't follow. This slide is not a product spec.

**Length:** 75-100 words. Let the visual carry weight.

---

**SLIDE 5 — Product (What Exists Today)**

*Purpose: Separate vision from current reality. Investors need to know what's live.*

Include:
- What is live right now (specific)
- What is in development (with realistic timelines)
- Screenshots of live product
- One key user flow explained simply

Avoid: Mixing live features with roadmap features without clear distinction. Overselling "coming soon."

**Design note:** Screenshots with a device frame look more polished than raw screenshots. Even a simple browser frame helps.

---

**SLIDE 6 — Traction**

*Purpose: The most important slide for a crypto project at any stage. Show proof.*

Include:
- Your single strongest metric large and prominent
- Supporting metrics (3-5 maximum)
- Month-over-month or week-over-week growth charts
- One compelling user quote or case study (if available)
- Logos of notable partners, exchanges, integrators

Avoid: Vanity metrics without context. Mentioning total value without clarifying it's TVL vs. volume. Comparing to peak metrics without current state.

**What metrics to show (prioritized):**
1. DAU / WAU / MAU (active users, not registered)
2. TVL (if DeFi protocol)
3. Revenue (if applicable)
4. Transaction count / volume
5. Community size (last resort — easy to fake)

---

**SLIDE 7 — Business Model**

*Purpose: Explain how the project sustains and grows economically.*

Include:
- How the protocol/platform generates revenue
- The token's role in the economic model
- Treasury design and runway
- How value flows between participants

Avoid: Circular token economics that can't sustain themselves without new buyers. Emission-funded "revenue" presented as real revenue.

**Be honest here:** Investors who understand crypto can spot unsustainable models. Address sustainability proactively.

---

**SLIDE 8 — Token**

*Purpose: Explain the token clearly and honestly.*

Include:
- Token name and ticker
- Total supply and current circulating supply
- Token utility (what it actually does — not just "governance")
- Simple distribution visualization
- Vesting schedule highlights
- Current price and market cap (if publicly trading)

Avoid: Misleading utility claims. Undisclosed investor token allocations.

**The one question to answer clearly:** "Why does this need a token?" Your answer should be specific and functional, not "decentralization."

---

**SLIDE 9 — Team**

*Purpose: Build conviction that these are the right people to build this.*

Include:
- Core team members with roles
- For each: one most-relevant credential (not a full CV)
- Team's specific experience relevant to this project
- Advisors (if genuinely advising — not name-drops)
- Links to public work if doxxed

Avoid: Long bios that don't connect to why they're suited for this project. Padding with advisors who aren't active.

**Format:** Photo (if comfortable), Name, Role, 1-line credential, 1-line "why they're here."

---

**SLIDE 10 — Competitive Landscape**

*Purpose: Show you understand the competition honestly and know where you stand.*

Include:
- Primary competitors (3-5)
- Comparison framework on dimensions that matter to your users
- Your honest strengths and weaknesses relative to each
- Why the market can support another player (or why you displace existing ones)

Avoid: Competitor comparison charts where you're green on everything and they're red — investors don't believe these.

**Design note:** A quadrant chart or table works well here. Pick 2-4 dimensions that genuinely differentiate.*

---

**SLIDE 11 — Roadmap**

*Purpose: Show where the project is going and that you have a plan.*

Include:
- Q-by-Q milestones for next 12-18 months
- Clear delineation between committed and aspirational
- Major milestones tied to the use of funds
- What "success" looks like by end of period

Avoid: Feature lists. Vague milestones like "platform improvements" or "ecosystem growth." Promising what you can't deliver.

**Format:** Visual timeline > bullet list. Shows sequential thinking and planning.

---

**SLIDE 12 — The Ask**

*Purpose: Make a specific, clear request.*

Include:
- How much you're raising
- Round structure (SAFE / SAFT / equity + token / token warrant)
- Use of proceeds (simple pie chart or 3-4 categories with percentages)
- What this funding buys you (time + milestones)
- How to engage: [contact email / Telegram / direct link]

Avoid: Vague asks. "We're looking for strategic partners and capital" is not an ask. State the number.

**The golden rule:** If you leave this slide unclear about how much you want and what for, you've lost the meeting.

# SECTION 6: ONE-PAGER TEMPLATE

*A one-pager is a single-page document that conveys your entire project. It's what you attach to cold emails, hand at conferences, and link in bio. It should be readable in under 90 seconds.*

# SECTION 7: BRAND VOICE WORKSHEET

*Your brand voice is how your project sounds in every piece of text it produces. Without a defined voice, your project sounds different across team members, seasons, and moods — which destroys trust.*

---

## PART A: Voice Attribute Framework

**Complete each sentence for your project:**

1. "We sound like __________ (brand/person/publication) — because both of us ____________."
2. "We never sound like __________ — because we refuse to ____________."
3. "If our project were a person at a conference, they would be the person who ____________."
4. "The one word we will never use in our marketing copy: ____________."
5. "When something goes wrong, we communicate like ____________. When something goes right, we communicate like ____________."

---

## PART B: The 4-Attribute Model

Define your brand voice using 4 attributes. For each:
- Name the attribute
- Describe it in 2 sentences
- Give an "ON voice" example
- Give an "OFF voice" example

**Template for each attribute:**

**ATTRIBUTE: [NAME]**
*What it means:* [2 SENTENCES]
*On voice:* "[EXAMPLE TEXT — 1-2 sentences]"
*Off voice:* "[EXAMPLE TEXT — 1-2 sentences]"

**Suggested attributes to consider:**

| Attribute | Means | Doesn't Mean |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Direct | We say what we mean without hedging | Rude or dismissive |
| Specific | We use real numbers and examples | Exhaustive detail for its own sake |
| Confident | We own our point of view | Arrogant or dismissive of alternatives |
| Human | We sound like a person, not a legal entity | Informal to the point of unprofessionalism |
| Honest | We acknowledge problems and limitations | Self-flagellation or over-sharing |
| Technical | We're comfortable with complexity | Excluding non-technical audiences |
| Warm | We care about our community | Sycophantic or generic |

## PART D: The Voice Application Guide

**When writing announcements:**
- Lead with the most important information
- One piece of information per announcement
- Length: as short as possible. Expand in threads or links.
- Tone: [YOUR CHOICE — see attributes above]

**When writing educational content:**
- Assume intelligence, not knowledge
- Define every technical term on first use
- Give concrete examples before abstract explanations
- End with what the reader should DO with this information

**When writing during difficult moments (bugs, criticism, bad news):**
- State the problem immediately (first sentence)
- Separate fact from speculation clearly
- Give timeline for next update
- Never use "we deeply apologize" without a specific action following it

**When writing community/culture content:**
- First person plural "we" (not "the team" — that's distancing language)
- Specific praise over generic (name people, name their contributions)
- Acknowledge emotion when appropriate ("this was hard" is fine)
- Don't perform positivity you don't feel — readers notice
