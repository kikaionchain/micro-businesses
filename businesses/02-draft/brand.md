# DRAFT — Brand Identity

---

## Name
**DRAFT**

## Tagline
*"Post something real."*

---

## Brand Concept
DRAFT is for the crypto teams who know they need to show up online but either hate writing content or don't have the time to do it right. The name is honest — these are drafts, starting points, templates to make your own. Not finished art. Useful infrastructure. The brand has the energy of a creative studio that happens to understand crypto culture deeply.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Blackout | `#111111` |
| Accent | Electric Yellow | `#F5E642` |
| Secondary | Off-White | `#F0EFEB` |

**Usage notes:**
- Blackout is the base. Everything lives on dark.
- Electric Yellow is the entire personality — borders, highlights, CTA buttons, key words. Used aggressively. This is what makes DRAFT look like it belongs on a creator's laptop, not a corporate deck.
- Off-White for body text on dark backgrounds. Pure white is too harsh.

## Typography Direction

**Primary:** Bold grotesque — **Space Grotesk** or **Neue Haas Grotesk Display** in heavy weights. Headlines are punchy. Large. Close-cropped.

**Secondary:** **IBM Plex Mono** for template text blocks, post previews, anything that should look like "copy ready to be used."

**Rule:** Categories and labels in all-caps mono. Post content in regular weight sans-serif. The contrast between functional and creative type creates visual hierarchy.

## Tone of Voice

- **Energetic but not cringey.** DRAFT knows crypto culture well enough to write with it, not about it.
- **Direct.** Every description leads with what it does, not what it "empowers" or "enables."
- **Slightly irreverent.** Not rude — just not buttoned up. Would say "this post slaps" unironically.
- **Anti-filler.** If a template is bad, DRAFT would say so and not include it.

**Example of on-brand copy:**
> "You've built something real. Now post about it. We wrote 90 templates so you don't have to stare at a blank box."

**Example of off-brand copy:**
> "Empower your crypto project's digital presence with our carefully curated social media content solutions."

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Priya Nair
**Handle:** @priya_drafts
**Bio:** Priya ran content for three crypto projects over four years — an L2, an NFT marketplace, and a DeFi protocol. She has written somewhere between 4,000 and "too many to count" crypto social posts. She burned out on it in 2024, quit her last contract role, and packaged everything she knew into DRAFT. She now lives in Singapore and consults for one project at a time. Her content has generated tens of millions of impressions collectively. She's never told anyone that.

**Persona notes:**
- Profile photo exists — warm, real, not overly professional
- Active on X but posts about content craft, not crypto prices
- Will occasionally respond to buyer DMs asking "can I adapt this one?" with a brief yes or no
- Credibility comes from the quality of the templates themselves
