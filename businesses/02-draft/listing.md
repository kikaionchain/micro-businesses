## FAQ (3 Questions)

**Q: Are these for Twitter/X only?**
A: No — the templates are written for any text-based social platform: Twitter/X, Farcaster, Lens, Telegram, Discord announcements, or anywhere you post text. Some templates include format notes specifying where they perform best.

**Q: How much editing do they need?**
A: You'll fill in [BRACKETS] with your project's details and adjust the tone to match your voice. Some templates will need minimal editing — just fill in the blanks. Others are starting points for something more original. The goal is to eliminate the blank-page problem, not to replace your voice.

**Q: Are these designed for any specific blockchain or sector?**
A: The templates are sector-agnostic and work for DeFi protocols, NFT projects, DAOs, L1/L2 chains, and any other crypto category. The [BRACKETS] system means you adapt them to your specific context.
