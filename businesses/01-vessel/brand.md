# VESSEL — Brand Identity

---

## Name
**VESSEL**

## Tagline
*"Carry your culture from day one."*

---

## Brand Concept
VESSEL is a tool brand for serious founders - the ones who understand that a token launch is a cultural event, not just a technical one. The name suggests something that holds, carries, and delivers - a container for your community's beliefs, story, and momentum. It's not flashy. It's dependable.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Ink Black | `#0D0D0D` |
| Accent | Warm Slate | `#4A5568` |
| Highlight | Brass Gold | `#B7922A` |

**Usage notes:**
- Ink Black dominates. It signals seriousness, weight, permanence.
- Warm Slate is for secondary text, dividers, metadata.
- Brass Gold is sparingly applied - pull quotes, CTA borders, section headers. It reads like something worth paying attention to.

## Typography Direction

**Primary:** Serif for headlines - something with authority. Think **Playfair Display** or **Freight Display**. These feel like a founder's journal, not a startup pitch deck.

**Secondary:** Clean sans-serif for body copy - **Inter** or **DM Sans** at regular weight. Readable, efficient, no ego.

**Rule:** Headlines are heavy and deliberate. Body copy is invisible - it just carries information.

## Tone of Voice

- **Confident, not arrogant.** VESSEL assumes you're smart. It doesn't explain things twice.
- **Sparse.** No filler sentences. If a word doesn't earn its place, cut it.
- **Founder-to-founder.** Written like advice from someone who already launched something - blunt, practical, occasionally dark about the hard parts.
- **Never hype.** VESSEL doesn't promise easy wins. It prepares you for real ones.

**Example of on-brand copy:**
> "Most token launches die before TGE. Not from bad tech - from bad culture. This playbook assumes you're building something worth believing in. The rest is your job."

**Example of off-brand copy:**
> "🚀 Launch your token the RIGHT way with our AMAZING template! Everything you need in one place!!! 🔥"

## Seller Persona

**Name:** Marcus Webb
**Handle:** @mwebb_builds
**Bio:** Marcus is a former startup operator who spent three years inside two crypto projects before going independent. He ran community at a DeFi protocol from zero to 80k holders, then consulted on four token launches - two of which he'd rather not name. He built VESSEL because every founder he worked with was reinventing the same wheel, badly. Now he makes tools. He lives in Lisbon. He does not offer 1-on-1 calls.

**Persona notes:**
- No profile photo (just a minimal initial avatar)
- Writes like he's been burned by overpromising before
- Sparse social presence - maybe 12 posts total on X, all signal no noise
- Credibility comes from specificity, not clout

## Brand Applications

- **Notion template:** Dark mode first. Clean hierarchy. Minimal icons - checkboxes, toggles, dividers only.
- **PDF:** Black background, brass gold headers, serif display type for section titles.
- **Listing copy:** Direct, no emojis, honest about what the product is and isn't.
