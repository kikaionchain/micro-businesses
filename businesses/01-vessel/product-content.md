# VESSEL — The Token Launch Playbook
### Notion Template — Full Content

---

> *"Most token launches die before TGE. Not from bad tech — from bad culture. This playbook assumes you're building something worth believing in."*

**How to use this template:**
Duplicate this page into your workspace. Work through each section in order. Nothing here is theoretical — every section asks you to produce something real. When you finish, you'll have a complete cultural operating system for your launch.

---

# SECTION 1: PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST

**Instructions:** Check each item only when it's genuinely done — not when it's "good enough." These 20 items represent the minimum viable culture infrastructure for a launch that doesn't embarrass you.

---

## The 20-Item Pre-Launch Checklist

### Identity & Narrative
- [ ] **1. Core belief statement written** — One sentence. What does your project believe that most people in crypto don't? (See Narrative Worksheet, Section 3)
- [ ] **2. Origin story documented** — Why does this exist? Who made it? What were they trying to solve? Written in plain English, not pitch-deck language.
- [ ] **3. Token name rationale finalized** — You can explain the name in 10 seconds. It means something. It's not a random animal or generic compound noun.
- [ ] **4. Project name consistent across all platforms** — Same spelling, same capitalization, same handle everywhere you exist.
- [ ] **5. Whitepaper or litepaper complete** — Not perfect. Complete. Someone outside your team has read it and confirmed it makes sense.

### Community Infrastructure
- [ ] **6. Primary community platform chosen** — Discord, Telegram, or X Community. One primary. Others are satellites.
- [ ] **7. Channel/category structure mapped** — You know what channels exist and why each one exists. No "general" dumping grounds.
- [ ] **8. Community rules written** — Specific, enforceable, human. Not copy-pasted from another project.
- [ ] **9. Moderation coverage planned** — At least 2 mods covering different time zones for the first 30 days.
- [ ] **10. Welcome message written** — First thing every new member sees. Tells them where to go and what this place is.

### Content & Announcement
- [ ] **11. Announcement post drafted** — The actual post. Not "we need to write the announcement." Written, reviewed, ready to publish. (See Section 4)
- [ ] **12. Thread/explainer written** — A full Twitter/X thread that explains the project from scratch. 8-12 tweets.
- [ ] **13. FAQ document exists** — 10+ questions answered. Lives somewhere public. (See Section 6)
- [ ] **14. Visual identity locked** — Logo, colors, banner. Used consistently across every platform.
- [ ] **15. First 5 pieces of content planned** — Post-announcement. You know what's going out on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21.

### Partnerships & Presence
- [ ] **16. At least 3 credible accounts are aware before launch** — Not paid shills. People who would mention you because they find it interesting.
- [ ] **17. Media or press outreach sent** — At least 2 crypto publications contacted. Even if none respond, you tried.
- [ ] **18. Launch date communicated internally** — Everyone on your team knows the exact date and time. Time zone specified.
- [ ] **19. Contingency plan exists for delay** — What do you post if you have to push the date? Written out.
- [ ] **20. Post-mortem calendar reminder set** — 30-day post-launch review scheduled. On someone's calendar right now.

# SECTION 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING FRAMEWORK

**The 5 Phases of Community Building**

Most projects try to run Phase 4 before they've done Phase 1. This framework keeps you honest.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks -8 to -4 Before Launch)

**What this phase is:** Building the container before you fill it.

**Goal:** A community that knows what it is and why it exists before a single outsider joins.

**Activities:**
- Write your community's founding document (1-2 pages, internal)
  - What are we building together?
  - What kind of people belong here?
  - What do we NOT tolerate?
  - What does success look like in 12 months?
- Set up channels and test them with 5-10 founding members (friends, advisors, early believers)
- Write and test all automated messages (welcome bot, rules acknowledgment, role assignments)
- Designate a Community Lead - this is a named role, not "whoever has time"
- Run 1 internal event (AMA, voice call, private workshop) before launch

**Metrics for Phase 1 completion:**
- [ ] Founding document exists
- [ ] Test community of 5-10 people active
- [ ] All automation tested and working
- [ ] Community Lead named and briefed
- [ ] 1 internal event completed

**Common mistake:** Skipping to Phase 2 because you're excited. A community with no culture becomes a price-chat. Don't skip Phase 1.

---

## Phase 2: Seeding (Weeks -4 to -1 Before Launch)

**What this phase is:** Finding and recruiting the people who will shape the community's culture.

**Goal:** 50-200 founding members who joined because they believe in the project, not because they're farming an airdrop.

**Activities:**
- Open an application or waitlist for founding members
  - Ask at least 2 real questions (what drew you here? what do you build?)
  - Manually review applications — reject anyone who looks like a bot or mercenary
- Begin "soft launch" content: educational posts, behind-the-scenes, building-in-public
- Host 1-2 small community calls with founding members
- Create a Founding Member designation (role, badge, or record in your docs)
- Document who your founding members are and why they matter

**Metrics for Phase 2 completion:**
- [ ] 50+ founding members admitted
- [ ] Each founding member personally welcomed by a human
- [ ] 1-2 community calls hosted
- [ ] Founding Member status formally designated

**Content to produce in this phase:**
- "What we're building" post (3x per week minimum)
- First behind-the-scenes update
- Introduction post from founding team members

---

## Phase 3: Activation (Launch Week)

**What this phase is:** The moment you open the doors. Controlled chaos with a system underneath.

**Goal:** Convert launch attention into retained community members.

**Activities:**
- Publish announcement post (see Section 4 for template)
- Pin orientation content in every channel
- All hands on deck: every team member active in community for 72 hours
- Respond to every genuine question within 2 hours
- Daily recap post: what happened today, what's coming tomorrow
- Identify 3-5 "natural connectors" in new members — invite them to help moderate

**What not to do in Phase 3:**
- Don't ignore the community to focus on Twitter metrics
- Don't let price/chart talk dominate — redirect to project substance
- Don't make promises about features you haven't built
- Don't ignore negative voices — address them directly and calmly

**Metrics for Phase 3 completion:**
- [ ] Announcement published and distributed
- [ ] Response time under 2 hours for first 72 hours
- [ ] Daily recap posted each day of launch week
- [ ] Natural connectors identified

---

## Phase 4: Cultivation (Weeks 2-8 Post-Launch)

**What this phase is:** Turning a crowd into a community.

**Goal:** Members who contribute, not just consume.

**Activities:**
- Launch a recurring community event (weekly AMA, bi-weekly office hours, monthly showcase)
- Create contribution pathways: how can members help? (Testing, feedback, content, ambassadors)
- Recognize contributors publicly and specifically
- Publish a community update weekly — progress, metrics (selectively), upcoming priorities
- Establish community feedback loops: polls, suggestion channels, direct outreach to power users

**The 80/20 rule for this phase:**
80% of your community management time should go toward the 20% of members who are active contributors. Grow the 20%, not the 80%.

**Metrics for Phase 4 completion:**
- [ ] Recurring event established and running
- [ ] At least 3 contribution pathways defined
- [ ] 5+ members publicly recognized as contributors
- [ ] Weekly community update cadence established

---

## Phase 5: Scaling (Month 3 Onward)

**What this phase is:** Building systems that outlast your direct involvement.

**Goal:** A community that generates its own culture, content, and new members.

**Activities:**
- Formalize an Ambassador Program
  - Clear criteria for becoming an ambassador
  - Defined responsibilities (not vague "spread the word")
  - Real benefits (access, recognition, occasional compensation)
- Document your community's culture in writing — things that would be lost if your core team disappeared
- Delegate moderation fully to trusted community members
- Create onboarding content that doesn't require a team member to deliver
- Begin community-led initiatives: hackathons, content contests, local meetups

**Questions to ask yourself at Phase 5:**
- If I stepped back for 2 weeks, would the community survive?
- Do members recruit new members organically?
- Does the community have inside jokes, rituals, and traditions of its own?

**Metrics for Phase 5 completion:**
- [ ] Ambassador Program launched with 5+ ambassadors
- [ ] Culture document written
- [ ] At least 1 community-led initiative completed
- [ ] Moderation fully delegated

# SECTION 3: NARRATIVE DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET

**Instructions:** Work through each prompt. Don't rush. These answers will power every piece of content you produce for the next 12 months.

---

## Part A: The Core Belief

**Prompt:** What does your project believe that most people in crypto don't?

Your answer must be specific. "We believe in decentralization" is not a belief — it's a cliché. A real belief creates disagreement.

**Bad example:** "We believe in building for the long term."
**Good example:** "We believe that most DeFi protocols are designed to extract value from users, not create it — and that this is a solvable problem, not an inevitable one."

**Your belief statement:**
> [Write 1-3 sentences here]

**Test:** Does this statement alienate some people? If it doesn't, it's not specific enough. A real belief has edges.

---

## Part B: The Origin Story

**Prompt:** Answer each question in 2-5 sentences:

**1. What problem were you trying to solve?**
> [Your answer]

**2. When did you first realize this problem was serious enough to build around?**
> [Your answer — be specific. A moment, a conversation, a frustration.]

**3. What did you try before building this? Why didn't it work?**
> [Your answer]

**4. What would the world look like if your project succeeded completely?**
> [Your answer — be specific, not vague ("a better world")]

---

## Part C: The Characters

**For each key person on your founding team:**

**Name:**
**Role:**
**Why they're here (not their resume — their real reason):**
**What they've given up or risked to build this:**
**What they'll be most proud of in 5 years:**

*Repeat for each founder/core team member.*

---

## Part D: The Enemy

**Every compelling narrative has something it's against.** This doesn't have to be a person or company — it can be a behavior, a system, or an assumption.

**Prompt:** What are you building against?

**Examples:**
- Against: the assumption that only developers can participate in on-chain governance
- Against: the norm of founders disappearing after TGE
- Against: the idea that NFTs are just speculation and have no lasting utility

**Your enemy:**
> [Write 1-2 sentences]

**Note:** This is not about hate. It's about contrast. Your enemy is what makes you necessary.

---

## Part E: The Promise

**This is your implicit contract with your community.**

**Prompt:** Complete each sentence:

"We will always _______________."
> [Your answer]

"We will never _______________."
> [Your answer]

"When we make mistakes, we will _______________."
> [Your answer]

"The one thing we will not compromise on is _______________."
> [Your answer]

**These answers should go in your community's founding document. They are binding.**

---

## Part F: The Voice

**How does your project sound?** Circle or highlight the words that fit. Cross out the ones that don't.

**Tone options:**
Serious / Playful / Irreverent / Technical / Accessible / Poetic / Blunt / Warm / Cold / Urgent / Calm / Provocative / Humble / Confident / Mysterious

**3 brands or accounts that sound like you want to sound:**
1. [Brand/account name + why]
2. [Brand/account name + why]
3. [Brand/account name + why]

**3 things you will never sound like:**
1. [What to avoid + why]
2. [What to avoid + why]
3. [What to avoid + why]

The long version of where this goes. Medium/Mirror article or long-form thread. 12-month vision written with specific targets.

**Post 4: The Ask**
What do you need from your community right now? Be specific. "More members" is not an ask. "We need 3 people with X skill to help us do Y by Z date" is an ask.

# APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**The 5 rules of a healthy launch:**

1. **Over-communicate.** Your community would rather hear too much than wonder if you've disappeared.
2. **Answer the hard questions first.** If you know something is going to be asked, answer it before they ask.
3. **Specificity beats hype.** "We shipped X to Y users, and here's what we learned" > "Big things coming soon!!!"
4. **Culture is content.** Your inside jokes, your rituals, your language — these are not soft. They are the product.
5. **Speed is generosity.** Responding fast to your community is a form of respect. Slow responses tell people you don't care.
