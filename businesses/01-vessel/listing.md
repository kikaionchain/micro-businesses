## Long Description (400 chars)

Most token launches fail because of culture, not code. VESSEL is the Notion template that first-time token founders actually need: a pre-launch checklist of 20 critical items, a 5-phase community building framework, a narrative development worksheet that finds your project's real story, a complete announcement template for every channel, a Week 1-4 post-launch content playbook, and a community FAQ template your members can actually use. Built by an operator who ran community from zero to 80k holders. Duplicate, fill in, launch.

## 5 Bullet Points: What's Included

- **20-item pre-launch checklist** — Every critical cultural and community infrastructure task before your token goes live. Nothing technical; everything that actually determines whether people stay.

- **5-phase community building framework** — From founding your internal culture (Phase 1) to building a self-sustaining community (Phase 5). Each phase has specific activities, milestones, and the one mistake most projects make.

- **Narrative development worksheet** — 6-part worksheet that surfaces your project's real story: core belief, origin, characters, enemy, promise, and voice. Your answers power every piece of content for the next 12 months.

- **Multi-channel announcement template** — Ready-to-edit templates for your launch tweet, 8-tweet thread, Discord/Telegram announcement, and Medium/Mirror article outline. Fill in the [BRACKETS] and publish.

- **Week 1-4 post-launch playbook** — Daily content direction for launch week, then weekly themes through the first month. Built around the arc your community needs: Show Your Work → Teach Something → Build Together → Show the Future.

## FAQ (3 Questions)

**Q: Is this a technical guide about deploying a token contract?**
A: No. This is a cultural and community guide. It assumes you've solved the technical side (or have someone who has). VESSEL is about the other 80% of the launch that most founders ignore until it's too late: narrative, community building, content, and the first 30 days of showing up.

**Q: Does this work if I'm a solo founder without a team?**
A: Yes, and in some ways it's more useful solo. VESSEL is built around what one focused person can actually execute. The community phases scale from small (5 founding members) to large — start where you are.

**Q: How do I use this? Is it a PDF or a Notion template?**
A: It's a Notion template. You'll receive a link to duplicate the page directly into your own Notion workspace. From there it's yours — edit, fill in, delete what doesn't apply. No login required beyond a standard free Notion account.
